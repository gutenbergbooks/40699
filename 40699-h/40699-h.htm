<h1 class="p6">A CHILDHOOD IN<br />
BRITTANY</h1>

<p class="p6">This little sheaf of childish memories has been
put together from many talks, in her own tongue,
with an old French friend. The names of her
relatives have, by her wish, been changed to other
names, taken from their Breton properties, or
slightly altered while preserving the character of
the Breton original.

<p class="p6 center b20"><b>A CHILDHOOD IN</b><br />
<b>BRITTANY</b></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
QUIMPER AND BONNE MAMAN</h3>

<p>I was born at Quimper in Brittany on the first
of August, 1833, at four o'clock in the morning,
and I have been told that I looked about me
resolutely and fixed a steady gaze on the people in
the room, so that the doctor said, "She is not blind,
at all events."</p>

<p>The first thing I remember is a hideous doll to
which I was passionately attached. It belonged
to the child of one of the servants, and my mother,
since I would not be parted from it, gave this
child, to replace it, a handsome doll. It had legs
stuffed with sawdust and a clumsily painted cardboard
head, and on this head it wore a <i>bourrelet</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
The <i>bourrelet</i> was a balloon-shaped cap made of
plaited wicker, and was worn by young children
to protect their heads when they fell. We, too,
wore them in our infancy, and I remember that I
was very proud when wearing mine and that I
thought it a very pretty head-dress.</p>

<p>I could not have been more than three years old
when I was brought down to the <i>grand salon</i> to be
shown to a friend of my father's, an Englishman,
on his way to England from India, and a pink silk
dress I then wore, and my intense satisfaction in it,
is my next memory. It had a stiff little bodice
and skirt, and there were pink rosettes over my
ears. But I could not have been a pretty child,
for my golden hair, which grew abundantly in
later years, was then very scanty, and my mouth
was large. I was stood upon a mahogany table,
of which I still see the vast and polished spaces
beneath me, and Mr. John Dobray, when I was
introduced to him by my proud father, said, "So
this is Sophie."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_010.jpg" width="550" height="398" alt="&quot;Quimper is an old town&quot;" />
<p class="caption">&quot;Quimper is an old town&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Dobray wore knee-breeches, silk stockings,
and a high stock. I see my father, too, very tall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
robust, and fair, with the pleasantest face. But
my father's figure fills all my childhood. I was
his pet and darling. When I cried and was
naughty, my mother would say: "Take your
daughter. She tires me and is insufferable."
Then my father would take me in his arms and
walk up and down with me while he sang me to
sleep with old Breton songs. One of these ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Jésus péguen brasvé,</p>
<p>Plégar douras néné;</p>
<p>Jésus péguen brasvé,</p>
<p>Ad ondar garan té!</p>
</div>

<p>This, as far as I remember, means, "May Jesus
be happy, and may His grace make us all happy."</p>

<p>At other times my father played strange, melancholy
old Breton tunes to me on a violin, which
he held upright on his knee, using the bow across
it as though it were a 'cello. He was, though untaught,
exceedingly musical, and played by ear on
the clavecin anything he had heard. It must have
been from him that I inherited my love of music,
and I do not remember the time that I was not
singing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>I see myself, also, at the earliest age, held before
my father on his saddle as we rode through
woods. He wore an easy Byronic collar and always
went bareheaded. He spent most of his
time on horseback, visiting his farms or hunting.</p>

<p>My father was of a wealthy bourgeois family
of Landerneau, and it must have been his happy
character and love of sport rather than his wealth&mdash;he
was master of hounds and always kept the
pack&mdash;that made him popular in Quimper, for the
gulf between the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and the <i>noblesse</i> was
almost impassable. Yet not only was he popular,
but he had married my mother, who was of an ancient
Breton family, the Rosvals. One of the
Rosvals fought in the Combats de Trente against
the English, and the dying and thirsty Beaumanoir
to whom it was said on that historic day,
"Bois ton sang, Beaumanoir," was a cousin of
theirs.</p>

<p class="caption">We played in the garden at Quimper</p>

<p>My mother was a beautiful woman with black
hair and eyes of an intense dark blue. She was
unaware of her own loveliness, and was much
amused one day when her little boy, after gazing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
intently at her, said, "<i>Maman</i>, you are very beautiful."
She repeated this remark, laughing, to my
father, on which he said, "Yes, my dear, you are."</p>

<p>My mother was extremely proud, and not at all
flattered that she should be plain Mme. Kerouguet,
although she was devoted to my father and
it was the happiest <i>ménage</i>. I remember one day
seeing her bring to my father, looking, for all her
feigned brightness, a little conscious, some new visiting-cards
she had had printed, with the name of
Kerouguet reduced to a simple initial, and followed
by several of the noble ancestral names of
her own family.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said my father, laughing.</p>

<p>"We needed some new cards," said my mother,
"and I dislike so much the name of Kerouguet."</p>

<p>But my father, laughing more than ever, said:</p>

<p>"Kerouguet you married and Kerouguet you
must remain," and the new cards had to be relinquished.</p>

<p>My mother, with her black hair and blue eyes,
had a charming nose of the sort called "<i>un nez
Roxalane</i>." It began very straight and fine, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
had a flattened little plateau on the tip which we
called "<i>la promenade de maman</i>." My memory
of her then is of a very active, gay, authoritative
young woman, going to balls, paying and receiving
visits, and riding out with my father, wearing the
sweeping habit of those days and an immense
beaver hat and plume.</p>

<p>Quimper is an old town, and the <i>hôtels</i> of the
<i>noblesse</i>, all situated in the same quarter and on a
steep street, were of blackened, crumbling stone.
From <i>portes-cochères</i> one entered the courtyards,
and the gardens behind stretched far into the country.</p>

<p>In the courtyard of our <i>hôtel</i> was a stone staircase,
with elaborate carvings, like those of the
Breton churches, leading to the upper stories, but
for use there were inner staircases. My mother's
boudoir, the <i>petit salon</i>, the <i>grand salon</i>, the <i>salle-à-manger</i>,
and the billiard-room were on the
ground floor and gave out upon the garden.</p>

<p>The high walls that ran along the street and
surrounded the garden were concealed by plantations
of trees, so that one seemed to look out into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the country. Flower beds were under the salon-windows,
and there were long borders of wild
strawberries that had been transplanted from the
woods, as my mother was very fond of them.
Fruit-trees grew against the walls, and beyond the
groves and flower beds and winding gravel paths
was an orchard, with apricot-, pear-, and apple-trees,
and the clear little river Odel, with its washing-stones,
where the laundry-maids beat the
household linen in the cold, running water.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to hear the <i>clap-clap-clap</i> on a
hot summer day. Is it known that the pretty pied
water-wagtail is called <i>la lavandière</i> from its love
of water and its manner of beating up and down
its tail as our washerwomen wield their wooden
beaters?</p>

<p>Beyond the river were the woods where I often
rode with my father, and beyond the woods distant
ranges of mountains. I looked out at all this
from my nursery-windows, with their frame of
climbing-roses and heliotrope. Near my window
was a great lime-tree of the variety known as
American. The vanilla-like scent of its flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
was almost overpowering, and all this fragrance
gave my mother a headache, and she had to have
her room moved away from the garden to another
part of the house. How clearly I see this room
of my mother's, with its high, canopied four-poster
bed and the pale-gray paper on the walls covered
with yellow fleurs-de-lis!</p>

<p>The wall-paper in my father's room was one of
the prettiest I have ever seen, black, all bespangled
with bright butterflies. Of the <i>grand salon</i> I remember
most clearly the high marble mantelpiece,
upheld by hounds sitting on their haunches. On
this mantelpiece was a huge <i>boule</i> clock, two tall
candelabra of Venetian glass, and two figures in
<i>vieux Saxe</i> of a marquis and a marquise that filled
us with delight. On each side of the fireplace
were two Louis XV court chairs&mdash;chairs, that is,
with only one arm, to admit of the display of the
great hoop-skirts of the period. I remember, too,
our special delight in the foot-stools, which were
of mahogany, shaped rather like gondolas and
cushioned in velvet; for we could sit inside them
and make them rock up and down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The houses of the <i>noblesse</i> swarmed with servants;
many of them were married, and their children,
and even their grandchildren, lived on with
our family in patriarchal fashion. Men and
maids all wore the costumes of their respective
Breton cantons, exceedingly beautiful some of
them, stiff with heavy embroideries, the strange
caps of the women fluted and ruffled, adorned with
lace, rising high above their heads and falling in
long lappets upon their shoulders, or perched on
their heads like butterflies. These caps were decorated
with large gold pins and dangling golden
pendants, and these and the materials for the costumes
were handed down in the peasants' families
from generation to generation. My young nurse
Jeannie&mdash;there was an old nurse called Gertrude&mdash;wore
a skirt of bright-blue woolen stuff and a
black-cloth bodice opening in a square over a net
fichu thickly embroidered with <i>paillettes</i> of every
color. Hers was the small flat cap of Quimper,
with the odd foolscap excrescence, rather like the
horn of a rhinoceros, curving forward over the
forehead. Needless to say, the servants did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
do their daily work in this fine array; while that
went on they were enveloped from head to foot in
large aprons.</p>

<p>The servants and the peasants in the Brittany
of those days had a pretty custom of always using
the <i>thou</i> when addressing their masters or the
Deity, thus inverting the usual association of this
mode of address; for to each other they said <i>you</i>,
and on their lips this was the familiar word, and
the <i>thou</i> implied respect. Our servants were of
the peasant class, but service altered and civilized
them very much, and while no peasant spoke anything
but Breton, they talked in an oddly accented
French. I remember a pretty example of this in a
dear old man who served my little cousin Guénolé
du Jacquelot du Bois-Laurel. Guénolé and I, because
of some naughtiness, were deprived of strawberries
one day at our supper, and the fond old
man, grieving over the discomfiture of his little
master, said, or, rather chanted, half in condolence,
and half in playful consolation: "Oh, le
pauvre Guén<i>o</i>lé, que tu es dés<i>o</i>lé!" accenting the <i>o</i>
in a very droll fashion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_022.jpg" width="300" height="333" alt="&quot;A very stately autocratic person&quot;" />
<p class="caption">&quot;A very stately autocratic person&quot;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>The servants were all under the orders of a very
stately autocratic person, the steward or major-domo.
It was he who directed the service from
behind his master's chair at the head of the table
and he who prescribed the correct costume for the
servants. His wife had charge of Jeannie and of
me; it was she who, when two little sisters and a
brother had been added to the family, took us
down to our breakfast and supervised the meal.
We had it in a little tower-room on the ground
floor, milk soup or gruel and the delicious bread
and butter of Brittany.</p>

<p>We lunched and dined at ten and five&mdash;such
were the hours of those days&mdash;with our parents in
the dining-room, and it was here that one of the
most magnificent figures of my childhood appears;
for my devoted father brought me back from Paris
one day a splendid mechanical pony, life-sized and
with a real pony-skin, the apparatus by which he
was moved simulating an exhilarating canter.
Upon this steed, after dessert, we children
mounted one by one, and we resorted to many
ruses in order to get the first ride of the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
This dear pony accompanied all my childhood.
He lost his hair as the result of an unhappy experiment
we tried upon him, scrubbing him with
hot water and soap, one day when we were unobserved.
He had a melancholy look after that, but
was none the less active and none the less loved.
When I saw his dismembered body lying in the
garret of a grand-niece not many years ago I felt a
contraction of the heart. How he brought back
my youth, and since that how many generations
had ridden him!</p>

<p>We played at being horses, too, driving each
other in the garden, where we spent most of our
days when at Quimper. Strange to say, even
while we were thus occupied, we always wore veils
tightly tied over our bonnets and faces to preserve
our skins from the sun. We all wore, even in
earliest childhood, stiff little dresses with closely
fitting boned bodices. My sister Eliane was delicate
and wore flannel next her skin; but my only
underclothing consisted of cambric chemise, petticoats,
and drawers, these last reaching to my
ankles and terminating in frills that fell over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
foot in its little sandaled shoe. When I came
back from a wonderful stay, later on, of four or
five years in England, a visit that revolutionized
my ideas of life, I wore the easy dress of English
children, and had bare arms, much to my mother's
dismay. Another change that England wrought
in me was that I was filled with discomfort when
I saw the peasants kneeling before us at Loch-ar-Brugg,
our country home; for in those days, although
the Revolution had passed over France, it
was still the custom for peasants to kneel before
their masters, and my mother felt it right and
proper that they should do so. I begged her not
to allow it, but she insisted upon the ceremony to
her dying day, and only when I came as mistress
to Loch-ar-Brugg with my children and grandchildren
was it discontinued.</p>

<p>Another early memory is the long row of family
portraits in the <i>salle-à-manger</i>. I think I must
have looked up at these from my father's shoulder
as he walked up and down with me, singing to me
while my mother went on with her interrupted dessert,
for the awe that some of them inspired in me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
seems to stretch back to babyhood. Some were so
dark and severe that it was natural they should
frighten a baby; but it was a pastel, in flat, pale
tones, of an old lady with high powdered hair,
whose steady, forbidding gaze followed me up and
down the room, that frightened me most. This
was an elder sister of my grandmother's, a March'-Inder,
who, dressed as a man, had fought with her
husband and daughter in the war of the Chouans
against the republic. Her husband was killed,
and her daughter, taken prisoner by a French officer,
had hanged herself, so the family story ran, to
escape insult. Another portrait of a great-grandmother
enchanted me then, as it has done ever
since, a charming young woman seated, with her
hands folded before her, her golden hair unpowdered,
her dress of citron-colored satin brocaded
with bunches of pale, bright flowers. And there
was a portrait of my grandmother in youth, with
black hair and eyes as black as jet. I thought
her very ugly, and could never associate her with
my dearly loved <i>bonne maman</i>.</p>

<p>I must delay no longer in introducing this most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
important member of the family, my mother's
mother, with whom we lived, for the old Quimper
<i>hôtel</i> was her dower-house.</p>

<p>Poor <i>bonne maman</i>! I see her still, in her deep
arm-chair, always dressed in a long gown of puce-colored
satin, a white lace mantilla, caught up
with a small bunch of artificial buttercups, on her
white hair. She wore white-thread lace mittens
that reached to her elbows, and her thin, white
hands were covered with old-fashioned rings.
My mother was her favorite daughter, and I, as
the eldest child of this favorite, was specially cherished.
Both of <i>bonne maman's</i> parents had been
guillotined in the Revolution. I do not think her
husband was of much comfort to her. He came
to Quimper only for short stays. He was <i>directeur
des Ponts et chaussées</i> for the district, but
also a deputy in Paris, and these political duties,
according to him, gave him no leisure for family
life. He was at least ten years younger than
<i>bonne maman</i>, very gay and witty, <i>l'homme du
monde</i> in all the acceptations of the term, full of
deference to <i>bonne maman</i>, whom he treated like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
a queen, with respectful salutes and gallant kissings
of the hand. He seemed very fond of his
home at Quimper when he was in it, but he seldom
graced it with his presence.</p>

<p>When I went up to see <i>bonne maman</i> in the
morning, she would give me her thumb to kiss, an
odd formality, since she was full of demonstrations
of affection toward me. I did not find the
salute altogether agreeable, since <i>bonne maman</i>
took snuff constantly, and her delicate thumb and
forefinger were strongly impregnated with the
smell of tobacco. Taking me on her knees, she
would then very gravely ask to see my little finger,
and when I held it up, she would scrutinize it
carefully, and from its appearance tell me whether
I had been good or naughty. Beside her chair
<i>bonne maman</i> had always a little table, the round
polished top surrounded by a low brass railing.
On this were ranged a number of toilet implements,
her glasses, scent-bottle, work-bag, and various
knickknacks. A very unique implement, I
imagine, was a little stick of polished wood, with a
tuft of cotton wool tied by a ribbon at one end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
This she used, when her maid had powdered her
hair or face, to dust off the superfluous powder,
and I can see her now, her little mirror in one
hand, the ribboned stick in the other, turning her
head from side to side and softly brushing the tuft
over her brow and chin. The table was always
carried down with her to the <i>petit salon</i>, where, her
morning toilet over, she was borne in her chair by
means of the handles that projected before and
behind it.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;Bonne maman was devoted

</div>

<p><i>Bonne maman</i> had an old carriage, an old horse,
and an old coachman. None of these was ever
used, since she never went out except on Easter
day, when she was carried in a sedan-chair to hear
mass at the cathedral near by. The sedan-chair
was gray-green with bunches of flowers painted on
it, and upholstered with copper-colored satin. It
was carried by four bearers in full Breton costume.
They wore jackets of a bright light blue, beautifully
embroidered along the edges with disks of
red, gold, and black; red sashes, tied round their
waists, hung to the knees; their full kneebreeches
were white, their shoes black, and their stockings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
of white wool. Like all the peasants of that time,
they wore their hair long, hanging over their
shoulders, and their large, round Breton hats were
of black felt tied with a thick chenille cord of red,
blue, and black, which was held to the brim at
one side by a golden fleur-de-lis, and that had a
scapular dangling from the end. Within the
chair sat my grandmother, dressed, as always, in
puce color; but this gala costume was of brocade,
flowers of a paler shade woven upon a dark
ground, and the lace mantilla of every-day wear
was replaced by a sort of white tulle head-dress,
gathered high upon her head and falling over her
breast and shoulders. I remember her demeanor
in church on these great occasions, her gentle authority
and <i>recueillement</i>, and the glance of grave
reproach for my mother, who was occupied in looking
about her and in making humorous comments
on the odd clothes and attitude of her fellow-worshipers.
On all other days the curé brought the
communion to my grandmother in her room. I remember
the first of these communions that I witnessed.
I was sitting on <i>bonne maman's</i> bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
when the curé entered, accompanied by his acolytes
in red and white, and I was highly interested
when I recognized in one of these important personages
the cook's little boy. The curé was going
to lift me from the bed, but <i>bonne maman</i>
said: "No; let her stay. When you are gone I
will explain to her the meaning of what she sees."
This she attempted to do, but not, I imagine, with
much success. Old Gertrude, Jeannie's chief in
the nursery, had of course already told me of <i>le
petit Jesus</i>, and I had learned to repeat, "Seigneur,
je vous donne c&oelig;ur." But <i>bonne maman</i> was
grieved to find that I did not yet know "Our
Father."</p>

<p>"Sophie does not know her Pater," she said to
my mother. "She must learn it."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is too young to learn it," said my
mother. But <i>bonne maman</i> was not at all satisfied
with this evasion and saw that the prayer was
taught to me. She was very devout, and confessed
twice a week; but more than this, she was
the best of women. I never heard her speak ill of
any one or saw her angry at any time, nor did I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
ever see her give way to mirth, though I remember
a species of silent laughter that at times shook her
thin body.</p>

<p><i>Bonne maman</i> was devoted to my father, even
more devoted than to her own sons, of whom she
had had eight. They had been so severely
brought up by her, but especially, I feel sure, by
my grandfather, that through exaggerated respect
and absurd ceremony they almost trembled during
the short audiences granted to them by their parents.
My father trembled before nobody. He
was always cheerful, good-tempered, and kind.
During our life at Quimper he was not much at
home, as he had a horror of receptions and visits,&mdash;all
the bother, as he said, of social life,&mdash;and the
time not spent in hunting was fully occupied in
seeing after his farms, his crops, and his peasants.
Therefore, when he came back for a three-or-four-days'
stay with us, it was a delight to young and
old. I see him now, sitting in a low chair beside
<i>bonne maman's</i> deep <i>bergère</i>, his head close to
hers, his pipe between his teeth,&mdash;yes, his pipe&mdash;for
<i>bonne maman</i> not only permitted, but even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
commanded, him to smoke in her presence, so much
did she value every moment of the time he could
be with her. So they smiled at each other while
they talked,&mdash;the snowy, powdered old head and
the fair young one enveloped in the midst of
smoke,&mdash;understanding each other perfectly; and
although their opinions were diametrically opposed,
politics was their favorite theme. They
must have taught me their respective battle-cries,
for I well remember that, riding my father's knee
and listening, while he varied the gait from trot to
gallop, I knew just when to cry out, "<i>Vive le Roi!</i>"
in order to please <i>bonne maman</i>, and "<i>Vive la République!</i>"
to make papa laugh. When disputes
occurred in <i>bonne maman's</i> room, they were between
my father and mother, if that can be called
a dispute where one is so gay and so imperturbable.
It was <i>maman</i> who brought all the heat and
vehemence to these differences, and, strange to say,
<i>bonne maman</i> always took my father's side against
her beloved daughter. My mother's quick
temper, I may add, displayed itself toward me
pretty frequently in slaps and whippings, no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
well deserved, for I was a naughty, wilful child;
whereas in all my life I never received a punishment
from my father. I remember his distress
on one of these occasions and how he said, "It is
unworthy to beat some one who cannot retaliate."
To which my mother, flushed and indignant, replied,
"It would indeed need only that." She was
a charming and lovable woman, but I loved my
father best.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_038.jpg" width="450" height="574" alt="&quot;I heard music constantly&quot;" />
<p class="caption">&quot;I heard music constantly&quot;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Bonne maman</i> was very musical, and in the
<i>petit salon</i>, when she was installed there for the
day, I heard music constantly, performed by two
young <i>protégés</i> of the house. One of these was
Mlle. Ghislaine du Guesclin, the youngest descendant
of our great Breton hero. It was a very poor,
very haughty family, and extremely proud of its
origin. Ghislaine's father, the Marquis du Guesclin
(for with a foolish conceit he had separated
the particle from the name) had died, leaving his
daughter penniless and recommending her to my
grandfather, who placed her as <i>dame de compagnie</i>
beside my mother and <i>bonne maman</i>. Ghislaine
was an excellent musician, and their relation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
of the happiest. The other <i>protégé</i> was called
Yves le Grand, and was the son of <i>bonne maman's
coiffeur</i>. His story was curious. As a boy of
fourteen or fifteen he had come three times a week
to wash the windows and doors, and while he
worked he sang all sorts of Breton songs and
strange airs that, as was learned later, were his
own improvisations. <i>Bonne maman</i>, noticing his
talent, had him taken to Paris by her husband, and
he was educated in the conservatory, where, after
ten years of admirable study, he took the second
prize. He returned to Quimper, and earned a
handsome livelihood by giving pianoforte lessons
while remaining in a sense our private musician,
for he was much attached to us all and accompanied
us on all our travels. Ghislaine sang
in a ravishing fashion, and Yves accompanied
her on the clavecin that stood in the <i>petit
salon</i>, mingling the grave accents of his baritone
with her clear soprano. When I first heard them
I was almost stupefied by the experience, cuddling
down into <i>bonne maman's</i> arms, my head sunk between
her cheek and shoulder, but listening with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
such absorption and with such evident appreciation
that <i>bonne maman</i> loved me more than ever
for the community of taste thus revealed between
us.</p>

<p>I must often have tired her. I was a noisy,
active child, and sometimes when I sat on her
knee and prattled incessantly in my shrill, childish
voice, she would pass her hand over her forehead
and say: "Not so loud, darling; not so loud. You
pierce my ear-drums; and you know that <i>le bon
Dieu</i> has said that one must never speak without
first turning one's tongue seven times round in
one's mouth." At this I would gaze wide-eyed at
<i>bonne maman</i> and try involuntarily to turn my
tongue seven times, an exercise at which I have
never been successful. I may add in parenthesis
that I have often regretted it. Another amusing
adage I heard at the same time from Gertrude. If
a child made a face, it was told to take care lest
the wind should turn, and the face remain like
that forever. I was much troubled by this idea
on one occasion when <i>maman</i> and Ghislaine had
been to a fancy dress ball. Ghislaine told me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
next day about the dances and dresses. <i>Maman</i>
had danced a minuet dressed in a Pompadour
costume, and she herself had gone as a deviless,
with a scarlet-and-black dress and little golden
horns in her black hair. I felt this to have been
a very dangerous proceeding, for if <i>le bon Dieu</i>
had noticed Ghislaine's travesty, He might have
made the wind turn, and she would then have remained
a deviless and been forced to live in hell
for all eternity.</p>

<p>A pretty custom at that time and in that place
was that the young matrons who went to such
balls and dinner-parties were expected to bring
little silk bags in which they carried home to their
children the left-over sweetmeats of the dessert;
so that we children enjoyed these entertainments
as much as Ghislaine and <i>maman</i>.</p>

<p>Ghislaine taught me my letters from a colored
alphabet in the <i>petit salon</i>, showing an angelic
patience despite my yawns and whimperings.
My memories of the alphabet are drolly intermingled
with various objects in the <i>petit salon</i> that
from the earliest age charmed my attention. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of these was an immense tortoise-shell mounted on
a tripod, and another a vast Chinese umbrella of
pale yellow satin, with silk and crystal fringes,
that, suspended from the ceiling in front of the
long windows that gave on the garden, was filled
with flowers. This had been an ingenious contrivance
of my father's, and <i>bonne maman</i> found
it as bewitching as I did, never failing to say
to visitors, after the first greetings had passed:
"Do you see my Chinese umbrella?" When I
had learned seven letters <i>bonne maman</i> gave me
four red <i>dragées de baptême</i>,&mdash;the sugar-almonds
that are scattered at christenings,&mdash;and promised
me as many more for each new attainment. Thus
sustained, I was able to master the alphabet and
to pass by slow degrees to Æsop's Fables, with pictures
and a yellow cover. It was later on that
Ghislaine began to coach me in all the <i>départements</i>
of France and their capitals. <i>Maman</i> lent
a hand in this and instituted a method that was
singularly successful. I still laugh in remembering
how at any time of the day, before guests, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
meals, or while we were at play, she might suddenly
call out to us, "Gers!" for instance, to which
one must instantly reply "Auch." Or else it was
"Gironde!" and the reply, "Bordeaux," must follow
without hesitation. If I replied correctly, I
was given fifty centimes; if incorrectly, I received
a slap. I used to dream of the <i>départements</i> and
their capitals at night. One rainy day I was playing
in the <i>petit salon</i>, lying at full length on the
floor and making a castle of blocks, when <i>maman</i>,
coming suddenly out of the library, a great tray
of books in her arms, cried out to me as she came,
walking very quickly, "Gare!" ["Take care!"]
Without moving and without looking up, I replied
obediently, "Nîmes" (the capital of Gard), and
an avalanche of books descended upon me, poor
<i>maman</i> and her tray coming down with a dreadful
clatter. <i>Maman</i> was not hurt, but very much
afraid that I was.</p>

<p>When she found us both, except for a few
bruises, safe and sound, she went off into a peal of
laughter, and I followed suit, much relieved; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
I had imagined for one moment that I had made a
mistake in my answer, and I found the punishment
too severe.</p>

<p>"You are sure I have not hurt you, darling?"
said <i>maman</i>, kissing me; and I replied with truth:</p>

<p>"No, <i>Maman</i>; but I should have preferred the
<i>gifle</i>." On that day, instead of fifty centimes, I
received a franc for consolation.</p>

<p>It was not until my brother's tutor came to us,
when I was eight or nine years old, that I ever had
any teacher but Ghislaine.</p>

<p>Poor Ghislaine! Hers was a rather sad story.
She had great beauty, thick, black hair, white
skin, her small prominent nose full of distinction,
but one strange peculiarity: there were no nails on
her long, pointed fingers. This, while not ugly,
startled one in noticing her hands. As I have said,
she had been left penniless, and it was difficult in
France, then as now, to find a husband for a <i>jeune
fille sans dot</i>. Ghislaine only begged that he
should be a gentleman. But after <i>bonne maman's</i>
death, when we had gone to live in Paris, Ghislaine
was left behind with my aunt's family, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
they finally arranged a marriage for her with a
notary. My mother was much distressed by this
prosaic match. She had for a time cherished the
romantic project of a marriage between Ghislaine
and Yves, who, besides being an artist, was the
best of men, sincere, devoted, and delicate.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">"Ghislaine taught me my letters"</p>
</div>

<p>For a descendant of du Guesclin the <i>coiffeur's</i>
son would, however, have been as inappropriate as
was the notary. The latter, too, was an excellent
man, and Ghislaine was not unhappy with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER II<br /><br />
ELIANE</h3>

<p class="p2">An important event in my child life was the
birth of my sister Eliane. I remember
coming in from the garden one day with a little
basket full of cockchafers that I had found, and
running to show them to <i>maman</i>. She was lying
in her large bed, with its four carved bedposts and
high canopy, and, smiling faintly, she said: "Oh,
no, my little girl; take them away. They will
creep and fly over everything." I was, however,
so much disappointed at this reception of my gift
that <i>maman</i>, bending from her pillows, selected
a specially beautiful green cockchafer and said
that that one, at all events, she would keep.
When next morning I was told that I had a little
sister, old Gertrude, in answer to my eager, astonished
questions, informed me that it was the cockchafer
who, fed on milk, had become very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
during the night and had given birth to a baby
cockchafer, which it had presented to my mother.
This story of the cockchafer became a family jest,
and later on, after my mother had had four children,
I remembered that when cockchafers were
referred to she would laugh and say: "No! no!
No more cockchafers for me, if you please! I
have had enough of their gifts."</p>

<p>The story, which was repeated to me on the
occasion of each subsequent birth, made a rather
painful impression upon me. I did not like the
idea of the baby cockchafer. Nor did I like my
little sister Eliane into whom the cockchafer had
grown. <i>Maman</i> remained in bed for a long time
and paid no more attention to me, and I was
deeply jealous. I was no longer allowed to go in
and out of her room as had been my wont, and
when my father took me in his arms and carried
me gently in to see my little sister, and bent with
me over the small pink cradle so that I might give
her a kiss, I felt instead a violent wish to bite her.
One day I was authorized to rock Eliane while my
father and mother talked together. I was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
pleased by this mark of confidence, and I slipped
into the cradle, unnoticed, my horrible doll Josephine,
all untidy and disheveled, not to say dirty,
so that she, too, might have a rocking. She lay
cheek to cheek with Eliane, already a young lady
ten days old, and the contact of this cold, clammy
cheek woke my little sister, who began to cry so
loudly that, in order to quiet her, I rocked with
might and main, and unless papa had rushed to
the rescue it is probable that Eliane and Josephine
would have been tossed out upon the floor. Jeannie
was at once summoned to take me away in disgrace,
and in <i>bonne maman's</i> room I was consoled
by two <i>dragées</i>, one white, I remember, and one
pink.</p>

<p>"You love your little sister, don't you, my darling?"
asked <i>bonne maman</i>, to whom Jeannie related
the affair of the rocking.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, the pink <i>dragée</i> in my mouth.</p>

<p>"Why not, dear?"</p>

<p>"She is horrid," I said. And as <i>bonne maman</i>,
much distressed, continued to question and expostulate,
I burst, despite the <i>dragées</i>, into a torrent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of tears and cried: "She is bad! She is ugly!
She cries!"</p>

<p>Eliane's christening was a grand affair. Her
godmother was <i>bonne maman</i>, and her godfather
my uncle de Salabéry, who brought her a casket
in which was a cup and saucer in enamel and also
an enamel egg-cup and tiny, round egg-spoon, and
this I thought very silly, since Eliane, like the
cockchafer, ate only milk. The casket was of
pale-blue velvet, and had Eliane's name written
upon it in golden letters. She was carried to the
cathedral by her nurse, who wore a gray silk dress
woven with silver fleurs-de-lis, a special silk, with
its silver threads, made in Brittany. The bodice
opened on a net guimpe thickly embroidered with
white beads. The apron was of gray satin scattered
over with a design, worked in beads, that
looked like tiny fish. Her coif was the tall
medieval hennin of Plougastel, a flood of lace falling
from its summit. Eliane, majestically carried
on her white-lace cushion, wore a long robe of
lace and lawn, and again I found this very silly,
since if by chance she wished to walk, she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
certainly stumble in it! The curé was replaced
by the bishop of the cathedral, who walked with
a tall golden stick, twisted at the top into a pretty
design. Papa, who was near me, explained to
me that this was called a crozier (<i>crosse</i>), which
puzzled me, as <i>crosse</i> is also the name for the
drumstick of a chicken. I also learned that what
I called the bishop's hat was a miter. When he
passed before us every one knelt down except me,
for I wished to gaze with all my eyes at the magnificent
apparition. The bishop leaned toward
me, smiling, and made a little cross on my forehead
with his thumb, and then he put his hand,
which was very white and adorned with a great
ring of amethyst and diamond, before my lips.
"Kiss Monseigneur's hand," papa whispered, and,
again much puzzled, I obeyed, for <i>maman</i> and
<i>bonne maman</i> gave their hands to be kissed by men
and never kissed theirs. When the bishop put the
salt in Eliane's mouth she made the most hideous
grimace. Heavens! how ugly she was! <i>Maman</i>
took her into her arms to calm her. I was near
<i>bonne maman</i> who had been borne in her sedan-chair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
into the cathedral, and I whispered to her:
"You say that she is pretty, <i>bonne maman</i>. Only
look at her now! Doesn't she look like an angry
little monkey!" But <i>bonne maman</i> reminded me
in a low voice that unless I was very good, I was
not to come to the christening breakfast, and,
hastily, I began to turn my tongue in my mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_054.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="The beach of Loctudiy" />
<p class="caption">The beach of Loctudiy</p>
</div>

<p>I remember that on this day <i>bonne maman</i> had
left her puce-color and looked like an old fairy as
she sat, covered with all her jewels, in the sedan-chair,
dressed in orange-colored velvet.</p>

<p>When we came out of the cathedral the square
was full of people, and all the children of Quimper
were there. My father, leading me by the hand,
was followed by a servant who carried a basket of
<i>dragées</i>. He took out a bagful and told me that
I was to throw them to the children, and this I did
with great gusto. What a superb bombardment
it was! The children rolled upon the ground,
laughed, and howled, while <i>maman</i>, and <i>bonne
maman</i> from the window of her chair, scattered
handfuls of <i>centimes</i>, <i>sous</i>, and <i>liards</i>, an old coin
of the period that no longer exists. Never in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
life have I seen happier children. They accompanied
us to our door and stayed for a long time
outside in the street, singing Breton canticles and
crying, "Vive Mademoiselle Liane!"</p>

<p>It must have been at about this time that I first
saw the sea and had my first sea-bath. Papa said
one day that he would take me to the beach of
Loctudiy, near Quimper, with old Gertrude. It
is a vast sandy beach, with scattered rocks that, to
my childish eyes, stood like giants around us.
Gertrude took off my shoes and stockings, and we
picked up the shells that lay along the beach in the
sunlight like a gigantic rainbow. What a delight
it was! Some were white, some yellow, some
pink, and some of a lovely rosy mauve. I could
not pick them up fast enough or carry those I already
had. My little pail overflowed, and the
painful problem that confronts all children engaged
in this delicious pursuit would soon have
oppressed me if my thoughts had not been turned
in another direction by the sight of papa making
his way toward the sea in bathing-dress. The sea
was immense and mysterious, and my beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
papa looked very small before it. I ran to him
crying:</p>

<p>"Don't go, papa! Don't go! You will be
drowned!"</p>

<p>"There is no danger of that, my pet," said my
father. "See how smooth and blue the water is.
Don't you want to come with me?"</p>

<p>I felt at once that I did, and in the twinkling of
an eye Gertrude had undressed me, my father had
me in his arms, and before I could say "Ouf!" I
was plunged from head to foot in the Atlantic
Ocean. It was my second baptism, and I still feel
an agreeable shudder when I remember it. My
father held me under the arms to teach me to swim,
and I vigorously agitated my little legs and arms.
Then I was given back to Gertrude, who dried
me and, taking me by the hand, made me run up
and down on the hot sand until I was quite warm.</p>

<p>When I came home, full of pride in my exploits,
I told <i>bonne maman</i> that during my swim I
had met a whale which had looked at me.</p>

<p>"And were you afraid of it?" asked <i>bonne
maman</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," I replied. "They do not eat children.
I patted it."</p>

<p>Perhaps my tendency to tell tall stories dates
from this time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER III<br /><br />
THE FÊTE AT KER-ELIANE</h3>

<p class="p2">It was shortly after Eliane's christening, and to
celebrate my mother's recovery, that my
father gave a great entertainment at Ker-Eliane,
near Loch-ar-Brugg.</p>

<p>Loch-ar-Brugg, which means Place of Heather,
was an old manor and property that my father had
bought and at that time used as a hunting-lodge,
and Ker-Eliane was a wild, beautiful piece of
country adjoining it, a pleasure resort, called after
my mother's name.</p>

<p>To reach Loch-ar-Brugg we all went by the
traveling carriage to my father's native town of
Landerneau. I dreaded these journeys, since inside
the carriage I always became sick; but on this
occasion I sat outside near an old servant of my
grandmother's called Soisick, the diminutive of
François, and was very happy, since in the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
air I did not suffer at all. Soisick was an old
Breton from Brest. He wore the costume of that
part of the country, a tightly fitting, long, black
jacket opening over a waistcoat adorned with
white-bone buttons, full knee-breeches of coarse,
white linen girded over the waistcoat with a red
woolen sash, with white woolen stockings, and
black shoes. One still sees very old Bretons wearing
this costume, but nowadays the peasants prefer
the vulgar, commonplace dress of modern work-people.</p>

<p>My father was waiting for us on the quay of
Landerneau. What joy I felt when I saw him!
When he climbed up beside me and Soisick my
happiness was complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_062.jpg" width="450" height="188" alt="&quot;The Château de Ker-Azel nearby, where we were to stay&quot;" />
<p class="caption">&quot;The Château de Ker-Azel nearby, where we were to stay&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Loch-ar-Brugg at that time was not suitably
arranged for our habitation, and we drove on to
the Château de Ker-Azel near by, where we were
to stay with my <i>tante</i> de Laisieu. This elder
sister of my mother's was a fat, untidy, shiftless
woman who had once been a beauty, but whose
abundant fair hair was now faded, and who went
about her house and gardens in the mornings <i>en camisole</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
When dressed for the day her appearance
was hardly more decorous, for she wore no
stays, and fastened the slender bodices of her old
dresses across her portly person in a very haphazard
fashion, so that intervals of white underclothing
showed between the straining hooks.
She was a singular contrast to my mother, always
so freshly perfect in every detail of her toilet.
The château was partly old and partly new and
very ugly, though the park that sloped down to it
was fine. Near the château stood a very old and
beautifully carved font that must have belonged
to a church long since destroyed. Later on, in
the days of her descendants, it was kept filled with
growing flowers and was a beautiful object, but
my aunt merely used it as a sort of waste-paper
basket for any scraps she picked up in the park.
We children used to conceal ourselves in it in our
games of hide-and-seek. I enjoyed myself among
my many cousins, for I was at this time so young
and so naughty that they tended to give way to me
in everything. One of them, however, a singularly
selfless and devout boy called France, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
fond of me for myself, and though I never paid
much attention to him, victim rather than play-mate
as he usually was in the games of the
others, I was always aware of his gentle, protecting
presence, and happy when his peaceful
gaze rested upon me. After long years of separation
and in our great old age we discovered, France
and I, that we had always been dear friends, and
in the few years that remained to us before his
recent death we saw each other constantly. But I
must return to the fête.</p>

<p>My mother and my aunt were absorbed in
preparations. It was a general hurly-burly, every
one running north, south, east, and west&mdash;to
Landerneau, to Morlaix, to Brest, to every place,
in short, that could boast some special delicacy.
And at last the great day came, and we children
were up with the lark. There was first to be a
luncheon for the huntsmen, friends of papa's, and
the ladies were to follow in carriages and to
enter Ker-Eliane from the highroad. But we preferred
the shorter way, by the deep paths overgrown
with hawthorn and blackberry. The boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
rushed along on the tops of the <i>talus</i>, the sort of
steep bank that in Brittany takes the place of
hedges, and even with Jeannie to restrain me I was
nearly as torn and tattered as they when we arrived
at Ker-Eliane. What a fairy-land it was!
Rocks and streams, heathery hills, and woods full
of bracken. An old ruin, strange and melancholy,
with only a few crumbling walls and a
portion of ivy-clothed tower left standing, rose
among trees on a little hill near the entrance, and
farther on, surrounded by woods of beech or pine,
were three lakes, lying in a chain one after the
other. Water-lilies grew upon them, and at their
brinks a pinkish-purple flower the name of which
I never knew. The third lake was so somber and
mysterious that my father had called it the Styx.
An ancient laurel-tree&mdash;in Brittany the laurels
become immense trees&mdash;had been uprooted in a
thunderstorm and had fallen across the Styx, making
a natural rustic bridge. We children were
forbidden to cross on it, but on this day I remember
my adventurous cousin Jules rushing to and
fro from one bank to the other in defiance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
authority. At the foot of the hill, below the ruin,
a clear, delicious stream sprang forth from a stony
cleft and wound through a valley and out into the
lower meadows, and at the entrance to the valley,
among heather and enormous mossy rocks, rose a
cross of gray stone without Christ or ornaments.
The peasants made pilgrimages to it on Good
Friday, but I never learned its history.</p>

<p>It was among the lower meadows, in a charming,
smiling spot planted with chestnuts, poplars,
and copper beeches, that the table for the thirty
huntsmen was laid in the shade of a little avenue.
Already the <i>crêpe</i>-makers from Quimper, renowned
through all the country, were laying their
fires upon the ground under the trees, and I must
pause here to describe this Breton dish. A carefully
compounded batter, flavored either with vanilla
or malaga, was ladled upon a large flat pan
and spread thinly out to its edge with a wooden
implement rather like a paper-cutter. By means
of this knife the <i>crêpes</i>, when browned on one side,
were turned to the other with a marvelous dexterity,
then lifted from the pan and folded at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
into a square, like a pocket-handkerchief, for, if
allowed to cool, they cracked. They were as fine
as paper&mdash;six would have made the thickness of
an ordinary pancake, and were served very hot
with melted butter and fresh cream, of which a
crystal jar stood before each guest, and was replenished
by the servants as it was emptied.</p>

<p>The <i>crêpes</i> were eaten at the end of the luncheon
as a sweet, and among the other dishes that I remember
was the cold salmon,&mdash;invariable on such
occasions, salmon abounding in our Breton rivers,&mdash;with
a highly spiced local sauce, <i>filet de boeuf
en aspic</i>, York ham, fowls, Russian salad, and the
usual cakes and fruits. The huntsmen seated at
this feast did not wear the pink coats and top-hats
of more formal occasions, but dark jackets and
knee-breeches and the small, round Breton cap
with upturned brim that admitted of a pipe being
tucked into it at one side. And so they carried
their pipes, as the peasants did, and the legitimists
among them had a golden fleur-de-lis fixed in
front. The ladies of the party, in summer dresses
and wide-brimmed hats, arrived when the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
substantial part of the repast was over, and their
carriages filled the highroad outside the precincts
of Ker-Eliane. A feast was spread at a little distance
for the peasants, and wine flowed all day.
After the feasting two famous <i>biniou</i>-players took
up their places on the high <i>talus</i> that separated
Ker-Eliane from Loch-ar-Brugg and played the
<i>farandol</i>, the <i>jabadao</i>, and other country-dances
for the peasants to dance to. The <i>biniou</i> is rather
like a small bagpipe and produces a wild, shrill
sound. The players wore a special costume: their
caps and their stockings were bright red; their
jackets and waistcoats bright blue, beautifully
embroidered; their full white breeches of coarse
linen. Like all the peasants at that time, they
wore their hair long, falling over the shoulders.
It was a charming sight to see the peasants dancing,
all in their local costumes. The women's
skirts were of black or red stuff, with three bands
of velvet, their bodices of embroidered velvet, and
they all wore a gold or silver Breton cross, hung on
a black velvet ribbon, round their necks, and a
<i>Saint Esprit</i> embroidered in gold on the front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
their bodices. Among the coifs I remember several
beautiful tall hennins. What a day it was!
Landerneau talked of it for years, and I have never
forgotten it. We children had our luncheon sitting
on the grass near the big table, and afterward
there were endless games among the heather and
bracken. My little sister Eliane appeared, carried
in her pink basket, and seemed to look about
her with great approval.</p>

<p class="caption">"A feast was spread at a little distance

</div>

<p>Later on in the day, when the dancing had begun,
we went to look on at that, and I wanted very
much to dance, too; but nobody asked me, for I
was too little. I must by that time have begun to
get very tired and troublesome, for I remember
that <i>maman</i> promised me a little wheelbarrow if I
would be good and allowed Jeannie to take me
back to Ker-Azel. I was already sleepy, as I had
drunk a quantity of champagne, with which the
servants had replenished my little liqueur-glass,
and I allowed myself at last to be carried away by
Jeannie, and fell asleep in her arms.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
THE OLD HOUSE AT LANDERNEAU</h3>

<p class="p2">During these early years of my life our
time, though mainly spent with <i>bonne
maman</i> at Quimper, was also given for many
months of the year to Landerneau, and a little
later on was divided between these two houses and
Loch-ar-Brugg. At Landerneau we lived in a vast
old house that had been part of my mother's marriage
dowry. The family house, equally old and
vast, of the Kerouguets was also at Landerneau,
and the house of dear Tante Rose, my father's
eldest sister. Landerneau was a picturesque old
town, so near the sea that the tides rose and fell
in the River Elorn, which flowed through it. A
legend ran that the part of Landerneau lying on
the southern banks of the river, still all wild with
great rocks that seemed to have been hurled together
by some giant's hand, had been reduced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
this condition by the devil. He had been traveling
through the country, and the inhabitants of the
southern half of Landerneau had refused to give
him food and drink, whereas those of the northern
half had suitably and diplomatically entertained
him; and it was in vengeance that he had hurled
these great rocks across the river, to remain as
permanent, if picturesque, embarrassments to
southern Landerneau. The morality of the story
was disconcerting, and very much puzzled me
when I was told it by old Gertrude. Our house
formed a corner of the principal street in the northern
side of the town. In the days of the Terror,
not so far distant in my childhood, it had been
used, with the house of Tante Rose across the way,
as a prison where the condemned were put on their
way to be guillotined at Brest, and a subterranean
passage that ran between the two houses, under the
street, conveyed the unfortunates swiftly and unobtrusively,
if occasion required it, from one
prison to the other. Another lugubrious memento
of that terrible time were the small square openings
in the floors of the upper rooms in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
houses. In our days they were used to summon
servants from below, but their original purpose
had been for watching the captives unobserved.
In the panels of the great oaken door that opened
on the street, in our house, were little grated
squares through which those who knocked for admittance
could be cautiously examined, and this
feature gave a further idea of the strange and
perilous circumstances of bygone days. The
kitchen, which was entered from a stone hall,
was our delight; it was called the every-day
kitchen. Enormous logs burned in a vast open
fireplace, archaically carved. At that time coal
was little known in the country, and the joints
were roasted on a spit before this fire, which looked
like the entrance to an inferno. There was a little
oven for stews and sweets, etc. Under a square
glass case on the mantel-shelf, lifted high above
the busy scene, stood a statue of the Virgin, very
old and very ugly, dressed in tinsel, a necklace of
colored beads around its neck. This was a cherished
possession of Nicole's, an old cook of my
grandmother's, who followed us everywhere, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
at its foot, under the glass cover, lay her withered
orange-flower wedding-wreath. The kitchen was
lighted at night by numbers of tallow candles that
burned in tall brass candlesticks, each with its pincers
and snuffer. (A candle with us does not
"take snuff"; it has "its nose blown"&mdash;<i>on mouchait
la chandelle</i>.) Brass warming-pans, which
we children called Bluebeard's wives, were
ranged along the walls, and a multitude of copper
saucepans hung in order of size, glittering with
special splendor on those spaces that could be
seen from the street, for "<i>où l'orgueil ne va t'il pas
se nicher</i>?" Through an opening in the wall opposite
the big windows dishes could be passed to
the servants in the dining-room during meals.</p>

<p>The dining-room windows looked out at a garden
full of flowers, the high walls embroidered
with espalier fruit-trees, plum-, cherry-, mulberry-,
and medlar-trees growing along the paths. At the
bottom of the garden was a large aviary containing
golden and silver pheasants, magpies, canaries,
and exotic birds that my father's naval friends had
brought him from their long Oriental voyages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
My father himself tended these birds, and I can
answer for it that they lacked nothing. I must
tell here of the strange behavior of a golden
pheasant. Despite papa's gentleness and care,
this bird seemed to detest him and would not let
him enter the aviary; but when I came with papa,
the pheasant would run to the wires and eat the
bread I held out to it from my hand. Papa was
surprised and interested, and suggested one day
that I should go with him into the aviary and "see
what the pheasant would say." No sooner said
than done. The bird rushed at papa and pecked
at his feet with a singular ferocity; then, feeling,
evidently, that he had disposed of his enemy, he
turned to me, spread out his wings before me,
bowed up and down as if an ecstasy of reverent delight,
and taking the bread I held out to him, he
paid no more attention at all to papa.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_078.jpg" width="450" height="486" alt="&quot;In the panels of the great oaken
door ... were little grated squares&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"In the panels of the great oaken
door ... were little grated squares"</p>
</div>

<p>The principal rooms on the ground floor of the
house opened on a stone hall with an inlaid marble
floor, where, in a niche carved in the wall, and
facing the wide stone staircase, stood another Virgin,
much larger and even older than Nicole's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
She was of stone, with a blunted, gentle countenance,
and hands held out at each side in a graceful,
simple gesture that seemed to express surprise
as much as benediction. As we came down from
our rooms every morning it was as if she greeted us
always with a renewed interest. Fresh flowers
were laid at her feet every day, and we were all
taught, the boys to lift their hats, the girls to drop
deep curtseys before her. Indeed, these respects
were paid by us to all the many statues of the
Virgin that are seen on our Breton roads. From
the hall one entered the salon, with its inlaid parquet
floor, so polished that we were forbidden to
slide upon it, for it was as slippery as ice, and
falls were inevitable for disobedient children.
On the mantelpiece was a clock representing
Marius weeping over the ruins of Carthage. His
cloak lay about his knees, and we used to feel that
he would have done much better had he drawn it
up and covered his chilly-looking bronze shoulders.
On each side of the clock were white vases
with garlands in relief upon them of blue convolvulus
and their green leaves. But what bewitched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
us children were the big Chinese porcelain
figures, mandarins sitting cross-legged, with heads
that nodded gently up and down at the slightest
movement made in the room. Their bellies were
bare, their eyes seemed to laugh, and they were
putting out their tongues. Black ibises upon their
robes opened wide beaks to catch butterflies. I remember
crossing the hall on tiptoe and opening
the salon-door very softly and looking in at the
mandarins sitting there in their still merriment;
and it required a little courage, as though one
summoned a spell, to shake the door and rouse
them into life. The heads gently nodded, the
eyes seemed to laugh with a new meaning at me
now; and I gazed, half frightened, half laughing,
too, until all again was motionless. It was as if a
secret jest had passed between me and the mandarins.
In an immense room to the left of the
salon that had once, perhaps, been a ball-room,
but was now used as a laundry, was a high sculptured
fireplace that was my joy. On each side the
great greyhounds, sitting up on their hind legs, sustained
the mantelpiece, all garlanded with vines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Among the leaves and grapes one saw a nest of
little birds, with their beaks wide open, and the
father and mother perched above them. And,
most beautiful of all, a swallow in flight only
touched with the tip of a wing a leaf, and really
seemed to be flying. Only my father appreciated
this masterpiece, which must have been a superb
example of Renaissance work, and when, years
afterward, my mother sold the house, the new
owner had it broken up and carted away because
it took up too much room!</p>

<p>On the two floors above were many bedrooms
not only for our growing family, but for that of
my Aunt de Laisieu, who, with all her children,
used to pay us long and frequent visits, so that
even in the babyhood of Eliane and Ernest and
Maraquita I never lacked companionship.</p>

<p>My mother's room was called <i>la chambre des
colonnes</i>, because at the foot of the bed, and used
there instead of bedposts, were two great stone
pillars wreathed with carving and reaching to the
ceiling. What a pretty room it was! In spring
its windows looked down at a sea of fruit-blossoms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and flowers in the garden beneath. The bed had a
domed canopy, with white muslin curtains embroidered
in green spots. Above the doors were
two allegorical paintings, one of Love, who makes
Time pass, and one of Time, who makes Love pass.
A deep, mysterious drawer above the oaken
mantelpiece was used by <i>maman</i> for storing pots
of specially exquisite preserves that were kept for
winter use. On her dressing-table, flowing with
muslin and ribbons, I specially remember the great
jar of <i>eau de Cologne</i>, which one used to buy, as if
it were wine, by the liter.</p>

<p>From this room led papa's, more severe and
masculine. Here there were glass cabinets fitted
on each side into the deep window-seats and containing
bibelots from all over the world. A group
of family miniatures hung on the wall near the
fireplace.</p>

<p>On a turning of the staircase was a bath-room,
with a little sort of sentry-box for cold douches,
and at the top of the house an enormous garret,
filled with broken old spinning-wheels and furniture,
bundles of old dresses, chests full of dusty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
papers. I found here one day <i>bonne maman's</i> betrothal-dress.
It was of stiff, rich satin, a wide
blue and white stripe, with a dark line on each
side of the blue and a little garland of pink roses
running up the white. The long, pointed bodice
was incredibly narrow. A strange detail was the
coarseness with which this beautiful dress was
finished inside. It was lined with a sort of sacking,
and the old lace with which it was still
adorned was pinned into place with brass safety-pins.
Finally, for my description of the house,
there was a big courtyard, with the servants' quarters
built round it, and a clear little stream ran
through a <i>basse-cour</i> stocked with poultry.</p>

<p>I had not seen this house for over fifty years
when, some time ago, I went to visit it. The new
proprietor, an unprepossessing person, was leaning
against the great oaken door. He permitted me,
very ungraciously, to enter.</p>

<p>I went through all these rooms that two generations
ago had rung with the sounds of our happy
young life, and it was misery to me. In the
kitchen, which had been so beautiful, the window-panes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
were broken, and the dismantled walls
daubed with whitewash, with dusty, empty bottles
where Nicole's Virgin had stood. Upon the table
was a greasy, discolored oil-cloth, where one saw
M. Thiers, with knitted eyebrows and folded
arms, surrounded by tricolor flags. The salon&mdash;I
sobbed as I stood and looked about it; all, all that
I had known and loved had disappeared. The
stone Virgin was gone from her niche in the hall.
Trembling, I mounted to my dear parents' rooms.
What desolation! Unmade beds and rickety iron
bedsteads; dust, disorder, and dirt. The carved
chimneypiece, with its great drawer, was gone; the
paper was peeled from the walls. Only over the
doors, almost invisible under their cobwebs, were
the painted panels of Love, who makes Time pass,
and Time, who makes Love pass. The garden
was a dung-heap.</p>

<p>When I came out, pale and shaken, the proprietor,
still complacently leaning against the
door, remarked, "<i>Eh bien</i>, Madam is glad to have
seen her house, isn't she!"</p>

<p>The animal! I could have strangled him!

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER V<br /><br />
TANTE ROSE</h3>

<p class="p2">Over the way lived Tante Rose. We children
liked best to go to her house by means
of the subterranean passage. It was pitch-dark,
and we felt a fearful delight as we galloped
through it at full speed, and then beat loudly upon
the door at the other end, so that old Kerandraon
should not keep us waiting for a moment in the
blackness. In the salon, between the windows,
her tame magpie hopping near her, we would find
Tante Rose spinning at her wheel. There were
pink ribbons on her distaff, and her beautiful,
rounded arms moved gently to and fro drawing
out the fine white linen thread. Sitting, as I see
her thus, with her back to the light, her white
tulle head-dress and the tulle bow beneath her
chin surrounded her delicate, rosy face with a sort
of aureole. She had a pointed little chin and gay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
blue eyes, and though she had snowy hair, she
looked so young and was so active that she seemed
to have quicksilver in her veins. A tranquil mirth
was her distinguishing characteristic, and even
when hardly more than a baby I felt that Tante
Rose was enchanting. Her first question was sure
to be, "Are you hungry?" and even if we had
just risen from a meal we were sure to be hungry
when we came to see Tante Rose. She would
blow into a little silver whistle that hung at her
waist, and old Kerandraon (we children pronounced
it Ker-le dragon) would appear with his
benevolent, smiling face.</p>

<p>"Take Mademoiselle Sophie's orders, Kerandraon,"
Tante Rose would say; but the dear old
man, who was a great friend, did not need to wait
for them.</p>

<p>"Demoiselle would like <i>crêpes</i> and fresh cream;
and there is the rest of the chocolate paste which
Demoiselle likes, too."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_090.jpg" width="550" height="365" alt="&quot;She did not conceal that she found him a dull companion&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"She did not conceal that she found him a dull companion"</p>
</div>

<p>"Bring what pleases you," Tante Rose would
say, "and take my key, Kerandraon, and fetch the
box of <i>sucre d'orge</i> from the shelf in my wardrobe."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
When Kerandraon had come ambling
back with his laden tray he would stop and talk
with us while we ate. He was seventy years old
and had a noble air in his long Louis XV jacket.
Tante Rose's mother had taken him from the
streets when he was a little beggar-boy of twelve.
He lived in the family service all his life, and
when he died at seventy-five he was buried in the
family vault. Jacquette, the magpie, sometimes
became very noisy on these festive occasions, and
Tante Rose would say: "Go into the garden, Jacquette.
<i>Tu m'annuis</i>" (so she pronounced <i>ennuies</i>).
And Jacquette, who seemed to understand
everything she said, would go obediently
hopping off. In the garden, adjoining the salon,
was a greenhouse full of grapes and flowers, and
that was another haven of delight on our visits
to Tante Rose. It was the prettiest sight to see
her mounted on a step-ladder cutting the grapes.
A servant held the ladder, and another the basket
into which the carefully chosen bunches were
dropped. Tante Rose's little feet were shod in a
sort of high-heeled brown-satin slipper called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
<i>cothurnes</i>, probably because they tied in classic
fashion across the instep, little gold acorns hanging
at the ends of the ribbons. I have the most
distinct recollection of these exquisite feet as I
stood beside the ladder looking up at Tante Rose
and waiting for her to drop softly a great bunch
of grapes into my hands. The fruit-trees of
Tante Rose's garden were famous. A great old
fig-tree there was so laden with fruit that supports
had to be put under the heavy branches; there
were wonderful Smyrna plums, and an apple-tree
covered with tiny red apples that were our joy.
From a high terrace in the garden one could watch
all that went on in the town below. Tante Rose's
cream, too, was famous. Great earthenware pans
of milk stood on the wide shelves of her dairy, and
when <i>maman</i> came to see her she would say, "May
I go into the dairy, Rose?" It was always known
what this meant. <i>Maman</i> would skim for herself
a bowlful of the thick, golden cream.</p>

<p>Even the kitchen had an elegance, a grace, and
sparkle all its own, and it is here that I can most
characteristically see Tante Rose distributing milk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
for the poor of Landerneau. Her farmers' wives
had brought it in from the country in large, covered
pails, and Tante Rose, dressed in a morning-gown
of puce-colored silk (like <i>bonne maman</i> in
this, she wore no other color), her full sleeves,
with their wide lawn cuffs turned back over her
arms, ladled it into jars, giving her directions the
while to the servants: "This for Yann. This for
Hervé [an old cripple]. Did this milk come
from the yellow? It is sure, then, to be very
good; take it to the hospital and&mdash;wait! This
little jug of cream to the <i>supérieure</i>; she is so fond
of it. And, Laic, this large jar is for the prison,"
for Tante Rose forgot nobody, and all with such
quiet grace and order. The poor of Landerneau
adored her. The thread she spun was woven at
her country place, La Fontaine Blanche, into linen
to make clothes for them, and she knitted socks and
waistcoats even as she went about the streets on
her errands of mercy. If the poor loved her, it
was respect mingled with a little fear that the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> felt, for she had no patience with
scandal-mongering and sharply checked their gossiping,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
provincial habits. The chatelaines of the
surrounding country sought her out and delighted
in her charm, her accomplishments, and her devil-may-care
wit. Tante Rose was married to a
wealthy and excellent Landernean, Joseph Goury,
whom we called Tonton Joson, and his friends,
Jason. He had a placid, kindly face, and stout,
fine calves incased in silk stockings. Still in love
with his wife, he was patiently submissive to her
gay sallies; for though very fond of him, she did
not conceal that she found him a dull companion.
Very drolly, though she tutoyéd him, she used always
to address him as "Monsieur Goury."
"<i>Tais-toi, Monsieur Goury</i>," she would say; "you
are as tiresome as the flies." And after enduring
his prosy talk for some time she would say quite
calmly: "I am beginning to drink hemlock. Go
away, Monsieur Goury&mdash;<i>va t'en</i>. You bore me
to distraction. You stun and stupefy me. Go
away. <i>Je n'en puis plus.</i>" And poor Tonton
Joson remaining helplessly gazing, she would lift
the little trap-door beside her chair, if the scene
took place in her room, and call out to the servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
below, "Tell Laic to come up and help
monsieur on with his coat."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, I was not thinking of going out,"
Tonton Joson would protest; and Tante Rose
would reply:</p>

<p>"<i>Mais tu sors, Monsieur Goury.</i>"</p>

<p>Tante Rose was very devout, but after her own
fashion. She read the office to herself every day,
but had many <i>librepensant</i> friends, with whom
she used good-temperedly to argue. Any bishop
who came to Landerneau stayed always with
Tante Rose.</p>

<p>Her cuisine was the best I have ever eaten; and
oh, the incredible abundance of those days! All
the courses were served at once upon the immense
table. The great silver soup-tureen, big enough
for a baby's bath, and so tall that she had to stand
up to it, was in front of Tante Rose, and before
she began to ladle out the platefuls, with the light,
accurate movements of her arms characteristic of
her, a servant carefully fastened behind her her
long sleeves <i>à la pagode</i>. It was really charming
to watch her serving the soup, and I remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
one guest asserting that he would eat <i>potage</i> four
times if Mme. Goury helped him to it.</p>

<p>An enormous salmon usually occupied the center
of the table, and there were six <i>entrées</i>, <i>four rôtis</i>,
two hot and two cold, and various <i>entremets</i> and
desserts. A favorite <i>entrée</i> was a <i>purée</i> of
pistachio nuts, with roasted sheeps' tails on silver
spits stuck into it. The hot dishes stood on silver
heaters filled with glowing charcoal. Between
the courses little pots of cream, chocolate, vanilla,
and coffee were actually passed and actually
eaten! Chocolate cream to fill the gap between
woodcock and <i>foie-gras</i>, for instance! Champagne-bottles
stood in silver coolers at each corner
of the table. I wonder that we all survived. On
the other hand, when Tante Rose or my mother received
the visits of their friends, there was no
afternoon tea to offer them, as nowadays. The
servants merely passed round little glasses of
Spanish wines and plates of small biscuits. The
good ladies of Landerneau afforded, I imagine,
much amusement to my mother and to Tante
Rose, who, though a native, was of a very different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
caliber. One little trait I remember was very
illustrative of the bourgeois habit of mind. At
that time, as now, lengths of velvet were included
in every <i>corbeille</i> offered to a bride by the bridegroom's
family, and the velvet dresses made from
them were dignified institutions worn year after
year. One knows how marked and unsightly velvet
soon becomes if sat upon, and it was a wise and
crafty fashion to have a breadth of perfectly
matching silk introduced between the full folds at
the back of these dresses, so that when one sat
down it was upon the silk. It was in regard to
this sensible contrivance that the ladies of Landerneau
were reported to declare that it was
strange indeed to see the <i>noblesse</i> so miserly that
they could not afford a whole velvet dress, and
therefore let silk into the back.</p>

<p class="caption">"I had only to sweep up the rubbish
... and carry it out of the

</div>

<p>Some of Tante Rose's children were, like herself,
very clever and charming, some very stupid,
like Tonton Joson. It can be imagined what
games we all had. Once, in the coach-house, my
older cousins put young Raoul into a large basket
with a number of smooth stones under him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
told him that they were eggs and that if he were
quiet and patient, they would hatch out. Then
by means of a rope and pulley to which the basket
was attached (it must have been used for raising
and lowering hay and fodder) we pulled poor
Raoul up to the rafters, and there we left him and
forgot all about him. His desolate cries were
heard after a time, and when he was rescued, it
was found that the rocking of the basket had
made him very seasick.</p>

<p>Of all our games the best were those in the
woods of La Fontaine Blanche. This property of
Tante Rose's, with its old manor-house dating
from the time of Queen Anne of Brittany, was
near Landerneau, and since papa went there
nearly every day, caring for it as if it were his own,
we were able to go with him and take full possession
of the beautiful woods. We were given
planks and tools, and we built a little hut on the
banks of the stream. I was so young that my
share of the labors was unexacting, as I had only
to sweep up the rubbish left by the builders and
carry it out of the wood in my little wheelbarrow;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
but I remember that pride with which I felt myself
associated in any capacity with such marvels
of construction. Not only was the hut entirely
built by my cousins, but they made an oven inside
it and even fabricated a sort of earthenware service
with the clay soil found along the banks of the
stream. It would never fire properly, however,
and therefore our attempts to bake bread were not
successful.</p>

<p>But <i>crêpes</i>, as pure-blooded young Bretons, we
could make, and our parents were often entertained
by us and regaled with them as they sat
under the trees. Oh, how happy we were! The
woods were full of lilies of the valley, and our
hut had been baptized by the curé of Landerneau
the château de la Muguetterie, while we were
called <i>Robinson Crusoes</i>, and this was to us all our
greatest glory.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VI<br /><br />
THE DEMOISELLES DE COATNAMPRUN</h3>

<p class="p2">Across the way from our house in Landerneau
lived two old maiden ladies, the
Demoiselles de Coatnamprun. The Marquis and
Marquise de Coatnamprun, their father and
mother, had died many years ago, and most of
the small fortune had been filched from them in
some iniquitous lawsuit. I remember them very
clearly, for I often went to see them with <i>maman</i>
and Tante Rose, who watched over them and protected
them; gentle, austere figures, dressed always
in threadbare black, almost like nuns, with
long, white bone rosaries hanging at their sides,
and on their breasts, tied with a red cord, great
crucifixes of brass and wood. Around their necks
they wore white handkerchiefs folded, the points
behind, and when they went out, old-fashioned
black <i>capotes</i>, which were large bonnets mounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
and drawn on wires, a quilling of white inside
around the face. The elder was called Isménie,
and the younger Suzette; they had the tenderest
love for each other.</p>

<p>Their house was one of the oldest in Landerneau
and was covered with strange carvings. The
great knocker always fascinated me, for it represented
a devil with his pitchfork, and one lifted
the pitchfork to knock. Almost always it was
one of the Demoiselles de Coatnamprun who
answered, and she always held a clean white
handkerchief by the center, the points shaken
out, and always swept us, as she appeared
before us in the doorway, a wonderful, old-fashioned,
stately court curtsey. The sisters were
plain, with dark, mild eyes, faded skins, and pale,
withered lips; but their teeth were beautiful, and
they had abundant hair. Isménie's features were
harsh, and her half-closed, near-sighted eyes gave
her a cold and haughty expression; but in reality
she was a lamb of gentleness, and no one seeing the
sisters in their poverty would have taken them for
anything but <i>grandes dames</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

always in threadbare black&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"Gentle, austere figures, dressed
always in threadbare black"</p>
</div>

<p>When we were ushered into the house it was
usually into the dining-room that we went. The
drawing-room, which was called the <i>salle de compagnie</i>,
was used only on ceremonious occasions,
Easter, the bishop's visit, or when the <i>noblesse</i>
from the surrounding country called, and the
proudest among them were proud to do so. So in
the <i>salle de compagnie</i>, where engravings of the
family coats of arms hung along the walls, the
ugly, massive mahogany furniture was usually
shrouded in cotton covers, and it was in the dining-room
that the sisters sat, making clothes for
the poor. Here the pictures interested me very
much; they were <i>naif</i>, brightly colored prints
bought at the Landerneau fairs, and representing
events in the lives of the saints. St. Christopher,
bending with his staff in the turbulent stream,
bore on his shoulder a child so tiny that I could
never imagine why its weight should incommode
him, and another doll-like child stood on the volume
held by St. Anthony of Padua. The oil-cloth
cover on the table had all the kings and
queens of France marching in procession round its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
border, the dates of their reigns printed above
their heads. The chairs were common straw-bottomed
kitchen chairs. <i>Maman</i> sometimes tried to
persuade the sisters to paint the chairs, saying that
if they were painted bright red, for instance, it
would make the room so much more cheerful.
But to any such suggestion they would reply, with
an air of gentle surprise: "Oh, but <i>maman</i> had
them like that. We can't change anything that
<i>maman</i> had." Their large bedroom was on the
first floor, looking out at the street. It was a most
dismal room. The two four-posted beds, side by
side, had canopies and curtains of old tapestry,
but this was all covered with black cambric muslin
and had the most funereal air imaginable. At the
head of Isménie's bed, crossed against the black,
were two bones that she had brought from the
family vault on some occasion when the coffins
had been moved or opened. The only cheerful
thing I remember was a childish little <i>étagère</i> fastened
in a corner and filled with the waxen figures
of the <i>petit Jésus</i>, and the tiny china dogs, cats and
birds that had been among their presents on Christmas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
mornings. To give an idea of the extreme
simplicity and innocence of the Demoiselles de
Coatnamprun I may say here that to the end of
their lives they firmly believed that <i>le petit Jésus</i>
himself came down their kitchen chimney on
Christmas eve and left their presents for them
on the kitchen table. <i>Le petit Jésus</i>, as a matter
of fact, was on these occasions impersonated by
<i>maman</i> and Tante Rose. Tante Rose always had
the key of the sisters' house, so that at any time she
could go in and see that nothing was amiss with
<i>ses enfants</i>, as she tenderly called them,&mdash;and indeed
to the end they remained lovely and ingenuous
children,&mdash;so she and <i>maman</i>, when the
sisters were safely asleep, would steal into the
house and pile every sort of good thing, from legs
of mutton to <i>galettes</i>, upon the table, and fill the
garden sabots that stood ready with bonbons,
handkerchiefs, and the little china figures of animals
the sisters so cherished. And always there
was a waxen figure of <i>le petit Jésus</i> and the card
with which he made his intention clear; for "<i>Aux
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Demoiselles de Coatnamprun, du petit Jésus</i>" was
written upon it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_110.jpg" width="150" height="179" alt="Old Kerandraon" />
<p class="caption">Old Kerandraon</p>
</div>

<p>Other instances of the sisters' ignorance of life
and the world I might give, but they would simply
be received with incredulity. Such types no
longer exist, and even then the sisters were unique.
I do not believe that in all their lives they knew an
evil thought; they were incapable of any form of
envy or malice or uncharitableness, and filled with
delight at any good fortune that came to others
and with gratitude for their own lot in life.
Sometimes Suzette, in the intimacy of friends,
would refer with simple sadness to the one drama,
if such it can be called, that had befallen them.
"<i>Oui</i>," she would say, "<i>Isménie a eu un chagrin
d'amour</i>." Once, when they were young, in their
parents' lifetime, an officer had been quartered
with them, a kindly, intelligent, honest young fellow
of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>, and at once aware of the
atmosphere of distinction that surrounded him.
He showed every attention to the sisters, and poor
Isménie found him altogether charming. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
never even guessed at her attachment. Indeed,
no such a marriage at that time would have been
possible, but she was broken-hearted when he went
away. Her sister was her confidante, and this
was the <i>chagrin d'amour</i> to which Suzette sometimes
referred.</p>

<p>I have said that when they walked out they
wore <i>capotes</i>. On one occasion Mlle. Suzette
found in a drawer, among old rubbish put away, a
crumpled artificial rose, a pink rose, and had the
strange idea of fastening it in front of her <i>capote</i>.
Isménie, when her near-sighted eyes caught sight
of it, stopped short in the street and peered at her
sister in astonishment. "But, Suzette, what have
you there?" she asked. Suzette bashfully told
her that she had found the rose and thought it
might look pretty. "No, no," said Isménie, turning
with her sister back to the house, "you must
not wear it. <i>Maman</i> never wore anything in her
<i>capote</i>." It required all my mother's skill to persuade
them to allow her to dress their hair for
them on the occasion of an evening party at Tante
Rose's, to which, as usual, they were going, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
"<i>maman</i>" had gone, wearing black-lace caps.
"<i>Voyons</i>, but you have such pretty hair," said
<i>maman</i>. "Let me only show you how charmingly
it can be done." They were tempted, yet uncertain
and very anxious, and then <i>maman</i> had the
opportune memory of an old picture of the marquise
in youth, her hair done in puffs upon her
forehead. She brought it out triumphantly, and
the sisters yielded. They could consent to have
their hair done as "<i>maman's</i>" had been done in her
youth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_114.jpg" width="450" height="350" alt="&quot;They were buried together on the same day&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"They were buried together on the same day"</p>
</div>

<p>We children always went with our parents to
the evening parties in Landerneau. <i>Maman</i> did
not like to leave us, and it will be remembered
that in those days one dined at five o'clock and
that we children had all our meals except breakfast
with our parents. It was at a dinner-party
at Tante Rose's that Mlle. Suzette, next whom I
sat, said to me smiling, with her shy dignity, "I
have a present here for a little girl who has been
good," and she drew a small paper parcel from
the silk reticule that hung beside the rosary at her
side. I opened it, and found, to my delight, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
sugar mouse and a tiny pipe made of red sugar
such as I knew <i>maman</i> would never allow us to
eat when we went to the confectioner's. But here,
in the presence of Mlle. Suzette, and the gift a
gift from her, I felt that I was safe, and I devoured
mouse and pipe at once, quite aware of
<i>maman's</i> amused and rallying glance from across
the table. "I saw you," she said to me afterward.
"Little ne'er-do-well, you know that I could not
forbid it when Mademoiselle Suzette was there!"</p>

<p>The only flower that grew in the Demoiselles
de Coatnamprun's garden was heliotrope, for that
had been "<i>maman's</i>" favorite flower. They were
poor gardeners, and the little <i>bonne</i> who came in
by the day to do the housework could give them
no help in the garden. So it was Tante Rose,
trotting on her high heels, a little garden fork on
her shoulder, who appeared to do battle with the
moss and dandelions and to restore a little order.
She always gave to this service the air of a delightful
game, and indeed, in her constant care of the
poor old ladies, had the prettiest skill imaginable
in making her gifts weigh nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"My dears," she would say, leaning forward to
look at their black robes, "aren't these dresses
getting rather shabby? Hasn't the time come
for new ones?"</p>

<p>"They are shabby," Isménie would answer
sadly, "but <i>que voulez-vous, chère Madame</i>, our
means, as you know, are so narrow. It costs so
much to buy a dress. We could hardly afford
new ones now."</p>

<p>"But, on the contrary, it doesn't cost so much,"
Tante Rose would say. "I know some excellent
woolen material, the very thing for your dresses,
and only five francs for the length. You can well
afford that, can't you? So I'll buy it for you and
bring it to-morrow."</p>

<p>And so she would, the innocent sisters imagining
five francs the price of material for which Tante
Rose paid at least thirty. Since the sisters were
very proud, for all their gentleness, and could consent
to accept nothing in the nature of a charity,
and since indeed they could hardly have lived at
all on what they had, Tante Rose had woven a
far-reaching conspiracy about them. Her tradespeople
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
had orders to sell their meat and vegetables
to the Demoiselles de Coatnamprun at about a
fifth of their value. Packets of coffee and sugar
arrived at their door, and milk and cream every
morning, and when they asked the messenger what
the price might be, he would say: "<i>Ces dames régleront
le compte avec Monsieur le Curé</i>," and
since they did not like to refuse gifts from the
curé, the innocent plot was never discovered. Of
course fruits from Tante Rose's garden and cakes
from her kitchen were things that could be accepted.
She would bring them herself, and have
a slice of <i>galette</i> or a fig from the big basketful
with them. They were rather greedy, poor darlings,
and since any money they could save went to
the poor, they could never buy such dainties for
themselves. One extravagance, however, they
had: when they came out to pay a visit, a piece of
knitting was always drawn from the reticule, and
when one asked what it was one was told in a
whisper: "Silk stockings&mdash;a Christmas present for
Suzette," or Isménie, as the case might be. Beautifully
knitted, fine, openwork stockings they were.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>Another contrivance for their comfort was invented
by Tante Rose. They were great cowards,
afraid of the dark and in deadly fear of the possible
robbers that might enter their house at night.
Tante Rose arranged that when they went to bed
a lighted, shaded lamp should be placed in their
window, the shade turned toward their room, the
light toward the street, so that any robbers passing
by would be deceived into thinking the house
still on foot and forego their schemes for breaking
in.</p>

<p>Their hearts were tender toward all forms of
life. I can see one of them rising from her work
to rescue a fly that had fallen into trouble and,
holding it delicately by the wings, lift the <i>persiennes</i>
to let it fly away. One day in their garden
I cried out in disgust at the sight of a great earthworm
writhing across a border.</p>

<p>"Oh, the horrid worm! Quick! A trowel,
Mademoiselle, to cut it in two."</p>

<p>But Mademoiselle Suzette came to look with
grieved eyes.</p>

<p>"And why kill the poor creature, Sophie? It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
does us no harm," she said, and helped the worm
to disappear in the soft earth.</p>

<p>The Demoiselles de Coatnamprun died one
winter of some pulmonary affection and within a
day of one another. They died with the simplicity
and sincerity that had marked all their lives,
and toward the end they were heard to murmur
continually, while they smiled as if in sleep,
"<i>Maman&mdash;Papa</i>."</p>

<p>Isménie died first; but since it was seen that
Suzette had only a few hours to live, the body was
kept lying on the bed near hers, and she did not
know that her beloved sister had been taken from
her. They were buried together on the same day.</p>

<p class="caption">"In the days of the Terror ... it

</div>

<p class="p2">There was another and very different old lady
in Landerneau of whom I was very fond and
whom, since she took a great fancy to me, I saw
often. Her daughter was a friend of <i>maman's</i>
and made a <i>mésalliance</i> that caused the doors of
Landerneau to close upon her. <i>Maman</i>, however,
remained devoted to her, and continued to
see as much of her as ever, and her mother, my old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
friend, was entirely indifferent to the doors, closed
or open, of Landerneau. She wore a brightly colored
Turkish silk handkerchief tied turban-wise
about her head, and soft gray-leather riding boots,&mdash;men's
boots,&mdash;so that she was known in her
quarter as <i>Chat-botté</i>. In her own house she wore
men's dress-breeches, short jacket, and high boots.
Her feet were remarkably small, and the wave of
hair on her forehead was as black as jet. She
was very downright and ready of speech, and used
to talk to me as though I were a person of her own
age. "Do you see, Sophie," she would say, "my
poor daughter is a great goose. She struggles to
be received, and gets only buffets for her pains.
Why give oneself so much trouble for nothing?"</p>

<p>The disconsolate daughter and the son-in-law
made their home with her in a great old house
standing on the banks of the river. He was a
wholesale wine merchant, and barrels and casks of
wine stood about the entrance. My old friend
lived almost entirely in her own room on the first
floor, the strangest room. It was at once spotlessly
clean and completely untidy. The bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
had no posts or canopy and was shaped like a
cradle. Bottles of salad-oil stood on the mantel-shelf,
and a bunch of carrots might be lying on the
table among bundles of newspapers. From the
windows one had beautiful views up and down
the river and could see the stone bridge that had
old houses built upon it. Across the river were
her gardens, and she used often to row me over
to them and to show me the immense old cherry-tree,
planted by her grandfather, that grew far
down the river against the walls of an old tower.
This tower had its story, and I could not sleep at
night for thinking of it. In her girlhood mad
people were shut up there. There was only a
dungeon-room, and the water often rose in it so
that the forsaken creatures stood up to their knees
in water. Food was thrown to them through the
iron bars of the windows, but it was quite insufficient,
and she gave me terrible descriptions of the
faces she used to see looking out, ravenous and imploring.
She remembered that the bones protruded
from the knuckles of one old man as he
clutched the bars. She used to pile loaves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
bread in her little boat, row across to the tower,
and fix the loaves on the end of an oar so that she
could pass them up to the window, and she would
then see the mad people snatching the bread apart
and devouring it. And when the cherries on the
great tree were ripe she used to climb up into the
branches and bend them against the window so
that they might gather the fruit themselves from
among the leaves, and she herself would gather all
she could reach and throw them in. They had
not even straw to sleep on. When one of them
died, the body was taken out, and this was all the
care they had. Such were the horrors in a town
where people across the river quietly ate and slept,
and the church-bells rang all day.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
BON PAPA</h3>

<p class="p2">My most vivid recollections of Grandfather
de Rosval place him at Landerneau,
where he would stop with us on his way to Quimper
during his tours of inspection. His arrivals in
the sleepy little town were great affairs and caused
immense excitement: post-chaise, postilion, whips
cracking, horns blowing, and a retinue of Parisian
servants. We children never had more than a
glimpse of him at first, for he withdrew at once to
his own rooms to rest and go through his papers.
When he made his entry into the salon,&mdash;the salon
of the slippery parquet and the nodding mandarins,&mdash;all
the household was ranged on each side,
as if for the arrival of a sovereign, and we had all
to drop deep curtseys before him.</p>

edge with golden oak-leaves, and a fine, handsome
head; but he was enormously, even ridiculously,
stout. With an often terrifying and even
repellent severity he mingled the most engaging
playfulness, and our childish feelings toward him
were strangely compounded of dislike and admiration.</p>

<p>When he arrived in the salon a lackey came behind
him, carrying a large linen bag filled with a
sweetmeat bought at Seugnot's, the great Parisian
confectioner. I always associate these sweetmeats
with <i>bon papa</i>. They were called <i>croquignoles</i>,
were small, hard, yet of the consistency of soft
chalk when one bit into them, and glazed with
pink, white, or yellow. After the salutations, <i>bon
papa</i> would take up his position before the mantelpiece
and beckon the servant to give him the bag
of <i>croquignoles</i>. We children, quivering with excitement,
each of us already provided with a small
basket, stood ready, and as <i>bon papa</i>, with a noble
gesture, scattered the handfuls of <i>croquignoles</i> far
and wide, we flung ourselves upon them, scrambling,
falling, and filling our baskets, with much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
laughter and many recriminations. Then, besides
the little case for <i>maman</i>, also from Seugnot's,
filled with tablets of a delicious <i>sucre-de-pomme</i>
in every flavor, were more dignified presents,
bracelets and rings for her and for our <i>Tante de
Laisieu</i> and boxes of beautiful toys for us. The
only cloud cast over these occasions was that after
having distributed all his bounties, <i>bon papa</i> sat
down, drew a roll of manuscript from his pocket,
and composed himself to read in a sonorous voice
poems of his own composition. Their theme, invariably,
was the delight of reëntering one's family
and country, and they were very pompous and
very long, sometimes moving <i>bon papa</i> almost to
tears. The comic scene of family prayers that
followed was pure relief, for even we children felt
it comic to see <i>bon papa</i> praying.</p>

<p>"And are they good children?" he would ask.
"Have they said their prayers?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">"The château was one of

</div>

<p>"Not yet, <i>mon père</i>," <i>maman</i> would answer.
"They always say their prayers at bedtime."
But <i>bon papa</i> was not to be so deterred from yet
another ceremony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Good, good!" he would reply. "We will all
say the evening prayers together, then."</p>

<p>And when we had all obediently knelt down
around the room, <i>bon papa</i> recited the prayers in
the same complacent, sonorous voice, making magnificent
signs of the cross the while. On one of
these occasions we were almost convulsed by poor
little Ernest, whom <i>bon papa</i> had taken in his
arms, and who was so much alarmed by the great
gestures going on over his head that he broke at
last into a prolonged wail and had to be carried
hastily away.</p>

<p>One of <i>bon papa's</i> poetic works I can still remember,
of a very different and more endearing
character. I was taken ill one morning while we
were living with him in Paris and had been given
to console me by a cousin of ours staying with us,
the Duchesse de M&mdash;&mdash;, a delicious little purse in
white, knitted silk, embroidered with pale blue forget-me-nots.
I told <i>maman</i> that I wished very
much to show this purse to <i>bon papa</i>, and that he
should be informed of my illness. So I wrote him
a note, and it was taken, with the purse, to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
room. Presently the little parcel, much heavier,
was brought back to me, and on opening my purse,
I found inside it a centime, a liard, a sou&mdash;every
coin, in fact, up to and including a golden twenty-franc
piece. And this is the poem that was sent
with the purse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="o1">"Vous voulez jeune Princesse</span></p>
<p>Que je me rends près de vous?</p>
<p>Que je baise de votre altesse</p>
<p>Les pieds, les mains, et les genoux?</p>
<p>Dans un instant je vais me rendre</p>
<p>A vos désirs et à vos v&oelig;ux,</p>
<p>Mais vous me permettrez de prendre</p>
<p>Deux baisers sur vos beaux yeux bleus."</p>
</div>

<p>Such a grandfather, it must be admitted, had
advantages as well as charms, yet our memory of
him was always clouded by the one or two acts
of cruel severity we had witnessed and of which
I could not trust myself to speak.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
LE MARQUIS DE PLOEUC</h3>

<p class="p2">In the Château de Ker-Guélegaan, near Quimper,
lived an old friend of my family's, the
Marquis de Ploeuc. The château was one of the
oldest in Finisterre, an immense weather-beaten
pile with a moat, a drawbridge, a great crenellated
tower, and a turret that, springing from the first
story, seemed, with its high-pointed roof, to be
suspended in the air. Tall, dark trees rose in ordered
majesty about the château, and before it a
wide band of lawn, called a <i>tapis vert</i>, ran to the
lodge-gates that opened on the highroad. From
the upper windows one saw the blue Brittany sea.
Along the whole length of the front façade ran a
stone terrace with seven wide steps; the windows
of the <i>salle d'honneur</i> opened upon this, and the
windows of the <i>petit salon</i> and the dining- and billiard-room.
The furniture in the <i>salle d'honneur</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
was of Louis XV white lacquer, court chairs, and
<i>tabourets de cour</i>. There were tall mirrors all
along the walls, and in the corners hung four great
crystal chandeliers. The curtains and portières
were of a heavy, white silk that had become gray
with time; they were scattered with bouquets of
faded flowers, and caught up and looped together
with knots of ribbon that had once been rose-colored.
This glacial and majestic room was seldom
used; it was in the <i>petit salon</i>, leading from it, that
guests usually sat. Here the chairs were carved
along their tops with garlands of roses and ribbons
so delicate that we children were specially forbidden
to touch them. The walls were hung with
tapestries, at which I used often to gaze with delight.
One saw life-sized ladies and gentlemen
dancing in stately rounds or laughing under trees
and among flowers and butterflies. The great
dining-room was paneled with dark wood carved
into frames around the portraits of ancestors that
were ranged along it. The coffers and the sideboards,
where the silver stood, were of the same
carved wood. I remember once going down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
peep at the kitchen in the basement, and the dark
immensity, streaming, as it were, with cooks, servants,
kitchen-boys, and maids, so bewildered and
almost frightened me that I never ventured there
again.</p>

<p>The old marquis was a widower, and his married
daughters, the Marquise de L&mdash;&mdash; and Mme.
d'A&mdash;&mdash;, usually lived with him and his unmarried
daughter Rosine, who became a nun. He
was a splendid old gentleman, tall, with a noble
carriage and severe, yet radiant, countenance. In
the daytime he dressed always in gray coat and
knee-breeches, with gray-and-black striped stockings
and buckled shoes. At night his thick, white
hair was gathered into a <i>catogan</i>,&mdash;a little square
black-silk bag, that is to say,&mdash;tied with a bow,
and he wore a black-silk suit. On festal occasions,
Christmas, Easter, or his fête-day, he became
a magnificent figure in brocaded coat and
white-satin waistcoat and knee-breeches; he had
diamond shoe- and knee-buckles, diamond buttons
on his waistcoat, and golden <i>aiguillettes</i> looped
across his breast and shoulder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>The diamond buckles he left to me, to be given
to me on my first communion, and in his lifetime
he had made for me a beautiful missal bound in
white parchment and closed with a diamond and
emerald clasp; inside were old illuminations.</p>

<p>In his youth M. de Ploeuc had been an officer
of the Chouans, and he was, of course, a passionate
royalist. He always wore the Croix de St.
Louis, a fleur-de-lis, with the little cross attached
by blue ribbon. I asked him once if it was the
same sort of decoration as my Grandfather de
Rosval's, which, I said, was larger and was tied
with red, and I remember the kindly and ironic
smile of my old friend as he answered, "Oh, no;
that is only the Légion d'honneur."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">"He was a splendid

</div>

<p>Brittany had many marquises, some of them
also old and distinguished; but he was the <i>doyen</i>
of them all, and was always called simply <i>le</i> marquis.
Any disputes or difficulties among the local
<i>noblesse</i> were always brought to him for his decision,
and on such occasions, if the discussions became
heated, he would say, "<i>Palsan bleu, mes
seigneurs, il me semble que vous vous oubliez ici</i>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
using the dignified oath already becoming obsolete.
His French was the old French of the court. He
never, for instance, said, "<i>Je vous remercie</i>," but,
"<i>Je vous rends gráce</i>."</p>

<p>Guests at Ker-Guélegaan arrived with their
own horses and carriages to stay a month or more,
and open house was kept. Breakfast was at six
for those who did not take communion at the mass
that was celebrated every morning in the chapel
adjoining the château; these breakfasted on returning.
It was permissible for ladies, at this
early hour, to appear very informally in <i>peignoirs</i>
and <i>bigoudics</i>. <i>Bigoudics</i> are curl-papers or ribbons.
The marquis almost always took communion,
but he usually appeared at the six o'clock
breakfast. After mass, once his correspondence
dealt with, he played billiards with Rosine, the
beautiful girl who became a nun in the order of
the Carmelites, an order so strict that those who
entered it died, to all intents and purposes, since
their relatives never saw them again, and at that
time were not even informed of their death. I see
Rosine very clearly, bending over the billiard-table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
under her father's fond gaze, and I can also
see her kneeling to pray in a corner of the <i>petit
salon</i>. It was with such simplicity that any suspicion
of affectation or parade was out of the question.
In the midst of a conversation she would
gently ask to be excused and would go there apart
and pray, sometimes for an hour. The ladies
quietly gossiping over their embroidery-frames
took it quite as a matter of course that Rosine
should be praying near them.</p>

<p class="caption">"Guests at Ker-Guélegaan arrived

</div>

<p><i>Déjeuner</i> was at ten, and it was then that one
saw how strongly feudal customs still survived at
Ker-Guélegaan. The marquis sat at the head of
the table, and behind his chair stood his old servant
Yvon, dressed in Breton mourning-costume in
memory of his defunct mistress; that is to say, in
blue, black, and yellow. The other servants wore
the livery of the house. Half-way down the table
the white cloth ended, and the lower half had
a matting covering. Here sat all the farmers of
Ker-Guélegaan and their families, taking their
midday meal with their master, while M. de
Ploeuc and his guests and family sat above. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
children were usually placed at a little side-table.
The meal aways began by M. de Ploeuc rising and
blessing the company with two outstretched fingers,
like a bishop, and he then recited a benediction.
He was always served first, another survival
of patriarchal custom, forced upon him,
rather, for I remember his protesting against it and
wishing my mother, who sat next him, to be served
before him; but she would not hear of it. During
the repasts a violinist and a <i>biniou</i>-player,
dressed in his Breton costume, played to us.</p>

<p>After luncheon the ladies drove or rode or
walked as the fancy took them, or, assembled
in the <i>petit salon</i>, talked over their work.
On hot days the blinds would be drawn down
before the open windows, but in the angle of each
window was fixed a long slip of mirror, so that
from every corner one could see if visitors, welcome
or unwelcome, were driving up to the <i>perron</i>.
<i>Goûter</i>, at three, consisted of bread, fruit, and
milk, and dinner was at five. After that the ladies
and gentlemen assembled in the <i>petit salon</i>
and talked, told ghost-stories and legends, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
played games till the very early bedtime of the
place and period.</p>

<p>This was the <i>train de vie</i> at Ker-Guélegaan; but
my memories of the place center almost entirely
around the figure of my old friend. I was his
constant companion. When he rode out after
luncheon to visit his farms, I would sit before him
on his old horse Pluton. He never let Pluton gallop
for fear of tiring him. "Do you see, <i>ma petite</i>,"
he would say, "Pluton is a comrade who has
never failed me. He has earned a peaceful old
age." We passed, in the wood behind the château,
a monument of a Templar that frightened
and interested me. He lay with his hands crossed
over his sword, his feet stayed against a couchant
hound, and I could not understand why he wore a
knitted coat. My old friend burst out laughing
when I questioned him, and said that I was as
ignorant as a little carp, and that it was high time
I went to the Sacré C&oelig;ur. He told me that the
knitted coat was a coat of mail, and tried to instil
a little history into my mind, telling me of the
crusades and St. Louis; but I am afraid that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
mind soon wandered away to Pluton's gently
pricked ears and to the wonders of the woods that
surrounded us. We had walks together, too, and
went one day to the sea-shore, where there was a
famous grotto often visited by strangers. When
we arrived at the black arch among the rocks and
I heard it was called the Devil's Grot, I was terrified,
clinging to M. de Ploeuc's hand and refusing
to enter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_148.jpg" width="450" height="508" alt="&quot;Maman wrote secretly

<p class="caption">"<i>Maman</i> wrote secretly

</div>

<p>"But why not, Sophie? Why not?" he questioned
me. "I am here to take care of you, and
there is no danger at all. See, Yann is lighting
the torches to show us the way."</p>

<p>"But the devil&mdash;the devil will get me," I whispered;
"Jeannie told me so."</p>

<p>Jeannie, indeed, was in the habit of punishing
or frightening me by tales of the devil and his
fork and tail and flames, and of how he would
come and carry off disobedient little girls; so it
was not to be wondered at that I feared to enter
his grot. I imagined that he himself lurked there
and would certainly carry me off, for I was well
aware that I was often very disobedient. M. de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Ploeuc sat down on a rock, took me on his knee,
and said:</p>

<p>"It is very wrong of Jeannie to fill your head
with such nonsense, my little one. Nothing like
her devil exists in the whole world, and you must
pay no attention to her stories."</p>

<p>He told me that the cavern was filled with beautiful
stalactites, like great clusters of diamonds,
and was so gentle and merry and reasonable that
the devil was exorcised from my imagination forever,
and I consented to enter the grotto.</p>

<p>Yann and the guide, a young farmer of Ker-Guélegaan,
led us in with their lighted torches,
and I suddenly saw before me, strangely illuminated,
a somber, yet gorgeous, fairy-land. Diamonds
indeed! Pillars of diamonds rose from the
rocky floor to the roof, and pendants hung in long
clusters, glittering in inconceivable vistas of splendor.
I was so dazzled and amazed that I gave
the vaguest attention to M. de Ploeuc's explanation
of the way in which the stalactites were
formed among the rocks. Indeed, that night I
could not sleep, still seeing diamond columns and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
pillars, and my dear old friend was full of self-reproach
next day when he heard that during the
night the Devil's Grot had given me a fever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_152.jpg" width="450" height="547" alt="&quot;As a country gentleman he had
lived and as a country gentleman

<p class="caption">"As a country gentleman he had

</div>

<p>Sometimes the Marquis de L&mdash;&mdash; accompanied
us on our expeditions, and sometimes I was even
left in his charge for an afternoon. I disliked this
very much, for he had no amusing stories to tell
me and walked very fast, and when my pace
flagged, he would pause to look at me reproachfully,
tapping his foot on the ground, and crying
out, as though I were one of his horses, "Get up!
Get up!"</p>

<p>M. de Ploeuc often took me, after lunch, into
his little study and played the flute to me. I
liked being in the study, but it rather frightened
me to see my old friend remove his teeth before beginning
to play. Their absence sadly altered his
beautiful and stately countenance, and gave, besides,
an odd, whistling timbre to his music.
Still, I listened attentively, looking away now and
then from his rapt, concentrated countenance to
the <i>tapis vert</i> outside, where the cows were cropping
the short grass, or glancing around rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
shrinkingly at the headless bust of Marie Antoinette
that stood on the mantelpiece. The head
lay beside the bust, and there was, even to my
childish imagination, a terrible beauty in the proud
shoulders thus devastated. This was one of two
such busts that had been decapitated by the Revolutionists.
The other belonged, I think, later on,
to the Empress Eugénie. When the marquis had
finished his thin, melancholy airs, it was my turn
to perform, and that I liked much better. I saw
that he loved to hear the old Breton songs sung in
my sweet, piping little voice, and it was especially
pleasant, our music over, to be rewarded by being
given chocolate pastils from a little enamel box
that stood on the writing-desk. While I softly
crunched the pastils M. de Ploeuc told me about
the countries where the plant from which the chocolate
came grew. It was not at all common in
Brittany at that time, and the pastils much less
sweet than our modern bon bons. M. de Ploeuc
also carried for his own delectation small violet
and peppermint lozenges in a little gold box that
he drew from his waistcoat-pocket, and these gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the pleasantest fragrance to his kiss. I often sat
on with him in the study, looking at the pictures in
the books he gave me while he read or wrote. He
wore on the third finger of his right hand an odd
black ring that had a tiny magnifying-glass fixed
upon it, and while he read his hand moved gently
across the page.</p>

<p>I owe a great deal to this dear old friend. He
took the deepest interest in my deportment, and
<i>maman</i> was specially delighted that he should extirpate
from my speech provincial words and intonations.
He entirely broke me of the bad habits
of shrugging my shoulders and biting my
nails.</p>

<p>"Only wicked men and women bite their nails,"
he told me, and pointed out to me as a terrible
warning the beautiful and coquettish Mme. de
G&mdash;&mdash;, one of his guests, who had bitten her nails
to the quick and quite ruined the appearance of
her hands.</p>

<p>"And is she so wicked?" I asked. At which he
laughed a little, and said that she must become so
if she continued to bite her nails. He made me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
practise coming into and going out of a room until
he was satisfied with my ease and grace.</p>

<p>"Do you see, <i>ma petite Sophie</i>," he said, "a
woman, when she walks well, is a goddess. Walk
always as if on clouds, lightly and loftily. Or
imagine that you are skimming over fields of
wheat, and that not an ear must bend beneath
your tread."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER IX<br /><br />
LOCH-AR-BRUGG</h3>

<p class="p2">And now I must tell of Loch-ar-Brugg, the
center of my long life and the spot dearest
to me upon earth. It was situated amidst the
beautiful, wild, heathery country that stretched
inland from Landerneau. I first saw it one day
when I drove over from Landerneau with my
father, and my chief recollection of this earliest
visit is the deep shade under the high arch of the
beech avenue and the aromatic smell of black currants
in an upper room where we were taken to
see the liqueur in process of being made. I was
given some to drink in a tiny glass, and I never
smell or taste <i>cassis</i> that the scent, color, warmth,
and sweetness of that long-distant day does not
flash upon me. The liqueur was being made by
the farmer's wife; for part of the house, which, as
I have said, papa at that time used only as a hunting-lodge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
was inhabited by a Belgian farmer and
his family. They were all seated at their midday
meal when we arrived, and another thing I remember
is that the eldest daughter, a singularly beautiful
young creature, with sea-green eyes and golden
hair, was so much confused at seeing us that she
put a spoonful of the custard she was eating
against her cheek instead of into her mouth,
greatly to my delight and to papa's.</p>

<p>"Monsieur must excuse her," said the mother;
"she is very timid." On which my father replied
with some compliment which made all the family
smile. I see them all smiling and happy, yet it
must have been soon after that a tragedy befell
them. News was brought to my father that the
farmer had hanged himself. The poor man's rent
was badly in arrears, but when he had last spoken
to my father about it, the latter, as was always
his wont in such circumstances, told him not to
torment himself and that he could pay when he
liked. <i>Maman</i> always suspected that my father's
agent had threatened the poor fellow and that he
had done away with himself in an access of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
despondency. Papa, overcome with grief, hastened
to Loch-ar-Brugg and remained there for a
week with the mourning family. He gave them
money to return to Belgium, and the beautiful
young daughter became, we heard, a very skilful
lace-maker.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_160.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="On the road to Loch-ar-Brugg" />
<p class="caption">On the road to Loch-ar-Brugg</p>
</div>

<p>I was too young for this lugubrious event to
cast a shadow on my dear Loch-ar-Brugg, but for
many years <i>maman</i> disliked the place. We still
lived at Quimper or Landerneau, using Loch-ar-Brugg
as a mere country resort; but by degrees the
ugly walls, nine feet high, that shut in the house
from the gardens and shut out the view were
pulled down, lawns were thrown into one another,
great clumps of blue hydrangeas were planted all
down the avenue, on each side, between each
beech-tree, and the house, if not beautiful, was
made comfortable and convenient. It was when
we were really established at Loch-ar-Brugg that
<i>maman</i> began to take the finances of the household
into her capable hands. She reproached my
father with his lack of ambition, and asked him
frequently why he did not find an occupation, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
which he always replied, "<i>Ma chère</i>, I have precisely
the occupations I care for." <i>Maman</i> wrote
secretly to <i>bon papa</i> in Paris and begged him to
find a post for her husband there, and an excellent
one was found at the treasury. But when the letter
came, and <i>maman</i>, full of joy, displayed it to
him, papa cheerfully, but firmly, refused to consider
for a moment any such change in his way of
life. As a country gentleman he had lived and as
a country gentleman he intended to go on living,
and so indeed he continued to the end of his long
life. I don't imagine that he made any difficulties
as to <i>maman</i> taking over the financial management.
He was quite incapable of saying no to a
farmer who asked to have his rent run on unpaid,
and realized, no doubt, that his methods would
soon bring his family to ruin. So it was <i>maman</i>
who received and paid out all the money. I see
her now, sitting at the end of the long table in the
kitchen, between two tall tallow candles, the peasants
kneeling on the floor about her while she
assessed their indebtedness and received their payments.
She was never unkind, but always strict,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and I was more than once the sympathetic witness
of an incident that would greatly have incensed
her. My father, meeting a disconsolate peasant
going to an interview with <i>la Maîtresse</i>, would
surreptitiously slide the needful sum into his
hand! What would <i>maman</i> have said had she
known that the money so brightly and briskly paid
to her had just come out of her husband's pocket!</p>

<p>I was always a great deal with papa at Loch-ar-Brugg.
At first I used to walk with him,&mdash;when
he did not take me on his horse,&mdash;trotting
along beside him, my hand in his. Later on,
when Tante Rose had given me a dear little pony,
I rode with him, and he had secretly made for me,
knowing that <i>maman</i> would not approve, a very
astonishing riding-costume. It had long, tightly
fitting trousers, a short little jacket, like an Eton
jacket, with a red-velvet collar,&mdash;red was my
father's racing color,&mdash;and on my long golden
curls a high silk hat. <i>Maman</i> burst out laughing
when she saw me thus attired and was too much
amused to be displeased. She herself rode a great
deal at this time, but it was to hunting- and shooting-parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
from which she would return with her
"bag" hanging from a sort of little pole fixed to
her saddle; and I remember that one day she
brought a strange beast that none of us ever saw in
Brittany again, a species of armadillo (<i>tatou</i>) that
her horse had trodden upon and killed.</p>

<p>It was at Loch-ar-Brugg, on one of those early
walks with papa, that my first vivid recollection
of a landscape seen as a beautiful picture comes to
me. We had entered a deep lane where gnarled
old trees interlaced their fingers overhead and
looked, with their twisted trunks, like crouching
men or beasts; and as we advanced, it became so
dark and mysterious that I was very much frightened
and hung to papa's hand, begging to be taken
out. He pointed then before us, and far, far
away I saw a tiny spot of light. "Don't be frightened,
Sophie," he said; "we are going toward the
sunlight." So I kept my eyes fixed on the widening
spot, holding papa's hand very tightly in the
haunted darkness; and when we suddenly emerged,
we were on the brink of a great gorge, and beyond
were mountains, and below us lay a tranquil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
silver lake. I have never forgotten the strange,
visionary impression, as of a beauty evoked from
the darkness. Papa told me the story of the lake;
it was called "le lac des Korrigans." The Korrigans
are Breton fairies&mdash;fairies, I think, more
melancholy than those of other lands, and with
something sinister and <i>macabre</i> in their supernatural
activities. They danced upon the turf, it is
true, in fairy-rings, but also, at night, they would
unwind the linen from the dead in the churchyards
and wash it in this lake. I felt the same
fear and wonder on hearing this story that all my
descendants have shown when they, in their turn,
have come to hear it, and my little granddaughter,
in passing near the lake with me, has often said,
shrinking against me, "Je ne veux pas voir les
blanchisseuses, Grand'mère."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Le Lac des Korrigans</p>
</div>

<p>Unlike the marquis, who filled my mind, or
tried to fill it, with the facts of nature and history,
papa, on our walks, told me all these old legends,
not as if he believed them, it is true, but as if they
were stories quite as important in their way as the
crusades; and perhaps he was right.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, when we were walking or riding, we
met convicts who had escaped from the great
prison at Brest. I was strictly forbidden ever to
go outside the gates alone; but once, at evening, I
slipped out and ran along the road to meet papa,
who, I knew, was coming from Landerneau on
foot. He was very much perturbed when he saw
me emerge before him in the dusk, and drew me
sharply to his side, and I then noticed that two
men were following him. Presently they joined
us and asked papa, very roughly, for the time.</p>

<p>"It is nine, I think," said my father, eyeing
them very attentively.</p>

<p>"You think? Haven't you a watch, then?"
said one of them.</p>

<p>I suppose they imagined that the rifle papa carried
over his shoulder was unloaded; but unslinging
it in the twinkling of an eye, he said sternly:</p>

<p>"Walk ahead. If you turn or stop, I shoot."
They obeyed at once, and as they went along we
heard a queer clink come from their ankles.</p>

<p>"Escaped convicts," said papa in a low voice.
"Poor devils! And you see, Sophie, how dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
it is for little girls to wander on the roads at
night."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_172.jpg" width="450" height="511" alt="&quot;Papa took out his hunting-flask
and made him drink&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"Papa took out his hunting-flask
and made him drink"</p>
</div>

<p>On another occasion we found a wretched, exhausted
man lying by the roadside, and papa
stopped and asked him what was the matter. He
must have felt the kindness of the face and voice,
for he said:</p>

<p>"I am an escaped convict, monsieur. For
God's sake! don't betray me. I am dying of hunger."
Papa took out his hunting-flask and made
him drink, and then, when we saw that the brandy
had given him strength, he put some money into
his hand and said:</p>

<p>"It is against the law that I should help you,
but I give you an hour before I raise the alarm.
Go in that direction, and God be with you!"</p>

<p>The church-bells were rung everywhere, answering
one another from village to village when a
convict was known to be at large; but on this occasion
I know that my father did not fulfil his duty,
the poor creature's piteous face had too much
touched him. Once, too, when we children were
walking with Jeannie along the highroad we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
caught sight of a beggar-woman sleeping in the
ditch. In peering over cautiously to have a good
look at her, we saw huge men's boots protruding
from her petticoats, and, at the other end, a black
beard, and we then made off as fast as our legs
would carry us, realizing that the beggar-woman
was a convict in disguise. At an inn not far from
Loch-ar-Brugg there was a woman of bad character
who sold these disguises to the escaped convicts.</p>

<p>Papa and my little brother and sister (Maraquita
was not then born) were not my only companions
at Loch-ar-Brugg. The property of Ker-Azel
adjoined ours, and I saw all my Laisieu cousins
continually, dear, gentle France, domineering
Jules, and the rest. There were nine of them. It
was Jules who told us one day that he had been
thinking over the future of France (the country,
not his brother), and had come to the conclusion
that we should all soon suffer from a terrible famine.
Famines had come before this, said Jules, so
why not again? It was only wise to be prepared
for them; and what he suggested was that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
should all accustom ourselves to eat grass and
clover, as the cattle did. If it nourished cows, it
would nourish us. All that was needed was a little
good-will in order that we should become accustomed
to the new diet. Jules was sincerely convinced
of the truth of what he said; but he was a
tyrannous boy, and threatened us with beatings if
we breathed a word of his plan to our parents.
We were to feign at meals that we were not hungry,
and to say that we had eaten before coming
to the table. I well remember the first time that
we poor little creatures knelt down on all fours
in a secluded meadow and began to bite and
munch the grass. We complained at once that we
did not like it at all, and Jules, as a concession to
our weakness, said that we might begin with
clover, since it was sweeter. For some time we
submitted to the ordeal, getting thinner and thinner
and paler, growing accustomed, it is true, to
our tasteless diet and never daring to confess our
predicament; we were really afraid of the famine
as well as of Jules. At last our parents, seriously
alarmed, consulted the good old doctor, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
nothing could be got from us but stout denials of
hunger. He took me home with him, for I was
his special pet, and talked gravely and gently to
me, reminding me that I was now eight years old
and of the age of reason, going to confession and
capable of sin. It was a sin to tell lies, and if I
would tell him the truth, he would never betray
my confidence. Thus adjured, I began to cry,
and confessed that we had all been eating nothing
but grass and clover. The doctor petted and consoled
me, told me that it was all folly on the part
of Jules, and that he would set it right without
any one knowing that I had told him. He kept
his promise to me. It was as if by chance he
found us all in our meadow next day, on all fours,
munching away. Jules sprang up, sulky and obstinate.</p>

<p>"Yes; we are eating grass and clover," he said,
"and we are quite accustomed to it now and like it
very much, and we shall be better off than the rest
of you when the famine comes."</p>

<p>The doctor burst out laughing, and his laughter
broke the spell Jules had cast upon us. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
told us that not only was there no probability of a
famine, no possibility even, France being a country
rich in food, but that even were there to be a
famine, we should certainly all be dead before it
came if we went on eating as the cattle did, since
we were not accommodated with the same digestive
apparatus as they. He described to us this
apparatus and our own, and at last even Jules,
who was as thin and as weary as the rest of us, was
convinced, and glad to be convinced. It was not
till many years afterward that we told our parents
the story.</p>

<p>One day we children were all in a deep lane&mdash;perhaps
the same that had frightened me years before&mdash;when,
at a turning, the most inconceivable
monster towered above us in the gloom. We recognized
it in a moment as a camel (a camel in
Brittany!), and with it came a band of Gipsies,
with dark skins, flashing teeth, bright handkerchiefs,
and ear-rings. Our alarm was not diminished
when we saw that they led, as well as the
camel, two thin performing bears. But as we
emerged into the light with the chattering, fawning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
crowd, alarm gave way to joyous excitement.
The camel and the bears were under perfect control,
and the Gipsies were not going to hurt us.
They asked if they might make the bears dance
for us, and we ran to show them the way to Loch-ar-Brugg.
<i>Maman</i>, in her broad garden hat, was
walking in the beech-avenue, and came at once to
forbid the Gipsies to enter, as they were preparing
to do; but as we supplicated that we should be
allowed to see the bears dance, she consented to
allow the performance to take place in the highroad
before the <i>grille</i>. We sat about on the grass;
the camel towered against the sky, gaunt, tawny,
and melancholy; and the bears, armed with
wooden staffs, went through their clumsy, reluctant
tricks. <i>Maman</i>, from within the <i>grille</i>, surveyed
the entertainment with great disfavor, and
it lost its charm for us when we heard her say:
"How wretchedly thin and miserable the poor
creatures look! They must be dying of hunger."
We then became very sorry for the bears, too, and
glad to have them left in peace, and while we distributed
sous to the Gipsies, <i>maman</i> went to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
house and returned with a basket of broken bread
and meat, which she gave to the famished beasts.
How they snatched and devoured it, and how
plainly I see <i>maman</i> standing there, the deep green
vault of the avenue behind her, the clumps of blue
hydrangeas, her light dress, her wide-brimmed garden
hat, and her severe, solicitous blue eyes as she
held out the bread to the hungry bears!</p>

<p>A great character at Loch-ar-Brugg was the
curé. It was he who had baptized me, for I was
baptized not at Quimper, but in the little church
of St. Eloi that stood at the foot of the Loch-ar-Brugg
woods and had been in the Kerouguet family
for generations. During my earliest years
there he was our chaplain, inhabiting one of the
<i>pavillons</i> in the garden with his old servant; later
on he was given the living of Plougastel, some
miles away, and my father had to persuade him to
accept it, for he was very averse to leaving Loch-ar-Brugg
and our family. Still, even at Plougastel
we saw him constantly; he drove over nearly
every day in his little pony-trap, and officiated
every Sunday at the seven o'clock mass at St. Eloi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
What a dear, honest fellow he was, and what
startling sermons I have heard him preach! Once
he informed his congregation that they would all
be damned like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Fénélon!
This threat, pronounced in Breton, was especially
impressive, and how he came by the two
ill-assorted names I cannot imagine, for he was
nearly as ignorant of books as his flock. He was
devoted to my father body and soul, being the son
of one of his farmers. They were great comrades.
Whenever my father had had a good day's shooting
he would go to the <i>pavillon</i> and cry: "Come
to dinner! There are woodcocks." And the
curé never failed to come. I see him now, with
his rustic, rugged face, weather-tanned, gay, and
austere. One of my first memories is of the small,
square neck ornament (<i>rabat</i>) that the clergy
wear,&mdash;a <i>bavette</i> we children called them,&mdash;stitched
round with white beads. I longed for
these beads, and when he took me on his knee I
always fixed my eyes upon them. Unattainable
indeed they seemed, but one day, noticing the intentness
of my gaze, he questioned me, and I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
able to express my longing. "But you shall have
the beads!" he cried, touched and delighted. "I
have two <i>rabats</i>, and one is old and past wearing.
Nothing is simpler than to cut off the beads for
you, my little Sophie."</p>

<p>His performance was even better than his promise,
for he brought me a bagful of the beads, collected
from among his curé friends, and for days I
was blissfully occupied in making chains, rings,
and necklaces. Some of these ornaments survived
for many years.</p>

<p>The curé was not at all happy in the presence
of fine people. "<i>Je me sauve!</i>" he would exclaim
if such appeared, and he would make off to the
garden, where he was altogether at home, true son
of the soil that he was. Here he would gird up
his <i>soutane</i> over his homespun knee-breeches, open
his coarse peasant's shirt on his bare chest, and
prune and dig and plant; and when he took a task
in hand it went quickly. One of my delights was
when he put me into the wheelbarrow and trundled
me off to Ker-Eliane to dig up ferns for
<i>maman's</i> garden.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>He, too, told me many legends. The one of
St. Eloi especially interested me. St. Eloi was
the son of a blacksmith and helped his father at
the forge in the tiny hamlet called after him.
One day as they were working, a little child came
riding up, mounted on a horse so gigantic that four
men could not have held him. "Will you shoe
my horse, good friends?" said the child,&mdash;who of
course was <i>l'Enfant Jésus</i>,&mdash;very politely. "His
shoe is loose, and his hoof will be hurt." The
father blacksmith looked with astonishment and
indignation at the horse, and said that he could
not think of shoeing an animal of such a size; but
the son, St. Eloi, said at once that he would do his
best. So <i>l'Enfant Jésus</i> slid down, and took a
seat on the <i>talus</i> in front of the smithy, and St.
Eloi at once neatly unscrewed the four legs of the
horse and laid them down beside the enormous
body. At this point in the story I always cried
out:</p>

<p>"But, <i>Monsieur le Curé</i>, did it not hurt the poor
horse to have its legs unscrewed?"</p>

<p>And the curé, smiling calmly, would reply:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"Not in the least. You see, this was a miracle,
my little Sophie."</p>

<p>So St. Eloi was able to deal with the great hoofs
separately, and when all was neatly done, the legs
were screwed on again; and the child remounted,
and said to St. Eloi's father before he rode away:</p>

<p>"You are a little soured with age, my friend.
Your son here is very wise. Listen to him and
take his advice in everything, for it will be good."</p>

<p>It was no doubt on account of this legend that
all the horses through all the country far and near
were brought to the church of St. Eloi once a year
to be blessed by the curé. This ceremony was
called <i>le Baptême des Chevaux</i>. The horses,
from plow-horses to carriage-horses and hunters,
were brought and ranged round the church in
groups of fours and sixes. At the widely opened
western door the curé stood, holding the <i>goupillon</i>,
or holy-water sprinkler, and the horses were slowly
led round the church, row after row, seven times,
and each time that they passed before him the curé
sprinkled them with holy water. After this initial
blessing the curé took up his stand within beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the christening-font, and the horses were led
into the church,&mdash;I so well remember the dull thud
and trampling of their feet upon the earthen floor,&mdash;and
the curé, with holy water from the font,
made the sign of the cross upon each large, innocent
forehead. Finally the tail of each horse was
carefully cut off, and all the tails hung up in the
church together, to be sold for the benefit of the
church at the end of the year, before <i>le Baptême
des Chevaux</i> took place again. This touching
ceremony still survives, but the horses are only led
round the church and blessed, not brought inside.</p>

<p class="caption">"A great character at Loch-ar-Brugg

</div>

<p>The Church of St. Eloi was very ancient, and
adorned with strange old statues of clumsily
carved stone painted in garish colors. One was of
a Christ waiting for the cross, His hands tied before
Him. It was a hideous figure, the feet and
hands huge and distorted, the eyes staring like
those of a doll; yet it had an impressive look of
suffering. There were no benches in the church
except for our family, near the choir. The peasants,
the men on one side, the women on the other,
knelt on the bare earth during the office. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
had used, always, when they entered the church,
to pass round before <i>les maîtres</i>, bowing before
them; but even my mother objected to this, and
the curé was told to give out from the pulpit that
<i>les maîtres</i> were no longer to be bowed to in
church, where there was only one master. <i>Maman</i>,
however, did not at all like it that my
father should insist on us children kneeling with
the peasants, and it was the one subject on which
I remember a difference of opinion between my
grandfather Rosval and papa. But the latter was
firm, and Ernest on the side of the men, Eliane
and I on the side of the women, we knelt through
mass. This was no hardship to us, for the kind
peasants spread their skirts for our little knees and
regaled us all through the service with <i>crêpes</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_192.jpg" width="250" height="355" alt="&quot;All the Breton women smoked&quot;" />
<p class="caption">"All the Breton women smoked"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Crêpes</i> seem to be present in nearly all my
Breton memories. The peasants made them for
us when we went to visit them in their cottages,
and it would have hurt their feelings deeply had
we refused them. We children delighted in these
visits not only on account of the <i>crêpes</i>, but on account
of the picturesque interest of these peasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
interiors. The one living-room had an earthen
floor and a huge chimney-place of stone, often
quaintly carved, and so large that chairs could be
set within it about the blazing logs. The room
was paneled, as it were, with beds that looked,
when their sliding wooden doors were closed, like
tall wardrobes ranged along the walls. They
were usually of dark old wood and often beautifully
carved. A narrow space between the tops of
these beds and the ceiling allowed some air (but
what air!) to reach the sleepers, and, within, the
straw was piled high, and the mattress and feather
bed were laid upon it. It was quite customary for
father, mother, and three or four children to sleep
in one bed, several generations often occupying a
room, as well as the servants, who were of the same
class as their masters. The beds were climbed
into by means of a carved chest that stood beside
them. These were called <i>huches</i>, and contained
the heirloom costumes, a store of bread, and the
Sunday shoes! Potatoes were kept under the bed.
In the window stood the table where the family
and servants all ate together, and above it hung,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
suspended by a pulley and string from the ceiling,
a curious contrivance for holding spoons. It was
a sort of wooden disk, and the spoons were held
in notches cut round the edge; it was lowered when
needed, and each person took a spoon. A great
earthenware bowl of creamy milk stood in the
center of the table, and with each mouthful of porridge,
or <i>fare</i>, the spoons were dipped, in community,
into the milk. <i>Fare</i> was a sort of thick porridge
made of maize, allowed to cool in a large
round cake, and cut in slices when cold. It was
one of the peasants' staple dishes, and another was
the porridge made of oatmeal, rye, or buckwheat,
served hot, with a lump of butter. For breakfast
they all drank <i>café au lait</i>, strong coffee boiled
with the milk; fortunately milk and butter were
plentiful. Of the hygienic habits of the peasants
at this time the less said the better; a very minor
detail was that the long hair of the men and the
closely coiffed tresses of the women swarmed with
vermin, and after every visit we paid, our heads
were always carefully examined. One peasant,
I remember, a good fellow, Paul Simur by name,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of whom my father was specially fond, was so
dirty and unwashed that a sort of mask of dirt had
formed upon his features. One day, at a hunting-party,
papa called to Paul to come and sit beside
him, and the other huntsmen, with singular bad
taste, began to make fun of poor Paul, who sat
much abashed, with hanging head. Papa affectionately
laid an arm about his neck and defended
him, until his friends finally cried out that they
wagered he would not kiss him. At this, although
he confessed afterward to the most intense repugnance,
he at once kissed Paul heartily. Poor Paul
was quite overcome. He came to my father afterward
with tears in his eyes and said, standing before
him and gazing at him:</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, mon maître, que je t'aime!</i>"</p>

<p>"And why don't you ever wash your face,
Paul?" papa asked him then, and Paul explained
that he had never been taught to wash and was
afraid it would seriously hurt him to begin. Papa
undertook to teach him. He got soap and soda
and hot water and lathered Paul, gently and
firmly, until at last his very agreeable features
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
were disinterred. Paul was perfectly delighted,
and his face shone with cleanliness ever after.</p>

</div>

<p>A special friend of mine among the peasants
was dear old Keransiflan, the lodge-keeper. I
was fond of joining him while he tended the road
in front of the lodge-gates and sitting on his wheelbarrow
with him to talk to him while he ate his
midday meal. This consisted of a huge slice of
black bread thickly spread with butter, and it
seemed to me that no bread and butter had ever
looked so good.</p>

<p>One day he must have seen how much I longed
for it, for he said, holding out the slice, "<i>Demoiselle,
en veux-tu</i>?" I did not need to be asked
twice, and can still see the great semicircle that I
bit into the slice, and I was happily munching
when <i>maman</i> appeared at the lodge-gates. She
was very much displeased, and mainly that I
should be devouring poor Keransiflan's luncheon,
and she rated me so soundly that the kind old man
interceded for me, saying, "<i>Notre maîtresse, c'est
moi qui lui l'ai donné</i>." I think that <i>maman</i>
must have seen that it gave him great pleasure to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
share his bread with me; at all events, Keransiflan
and I, sitting on our wheelbarrow, were allowed to
go on eating in peace.</p>

<p>But the peasants were a hard, harsh race and
pitiless in their dealings toward one another.
Their treatment of their old people was terrible.
If an old mother, past work, had no money, she
was ruthlessly turned out to beg. One sometimes
saw such an old woman sitting on a <i>talus</i>, her pitiful
bundle of rags beside her, helpless and stupefied.
I remember a story that was told me by one
of my servants about such an old woman that she
had known. She had four hundred francs, and
was cared for in the family of one son until it was
spent, when she was turned out. Another son
more kindly took her in; but his wife was a hard
woman, and though she finally consented to accept
the useless old mother into the household, she
grudged every sou spent upon her. Thus, though
the only two joys remaining her in life were snuff
and coffee, only two sous a week was allowed her
for tobacco, and as for coffee, she was given never
a drop. When she was dying she told the servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
from whom I had the story that what made her
suffer most had been to sit by in the morning and
smell the delicious odor of the coffee as the others
drank it. This has always seemed to me a heart-piercing
story. All the Breton women smoked, by
the way, and pipes, and in a curious fashion; for
the bowl was turned downward, though why, I do
not know.

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER X<br /><br />
THE PARDON AT FOLGOAT</h3>

<p class="p2">I was taken while I was a child at Loch-ar-Brugg
to the famous <i>Pardon de Folgoat</i>, to
which people came from all Brittany. In Folgoat
was the summer residence of Anne de Bretagne,
and in the vast hall of the château she had held
her audiences. The château is now the presbytery,
and is opposite the church, of which there is
a legend. A poor child, Yann Salacin, who was
devoid of reason, spent hours every day before the
altar of the Virgin, which he decorated with the
wild flowers that he gathered in the fields, and
wandered in the forest, swinging on the branches
of the trees, always singing Ave Maria, the only
words he was ever heard to pronounce. He
begged for food from door to door and slept in
the barns. The peasants became impatient with
him and began to whisper that he was possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of an evil spirit, and at last they drove him out
of the village. The curé, who was a good man,
missed him in the church, sought vainly for him,
and at last heard what had happened. He was
filled with indignation, and told the peasants that
they had committed a crime. Then he set out to
look for poor Yann, and found him at last in a
distant forest, dead with hunger. He brought the
body back to Folgoat and buried it near the
church, and one day he saw that a tall white lily
had grown up from the grave; when he opened
the grave he found that the lily sprang from the
lips of the little innocent, and on the petals of the
flower one could read in letters of gold Ave Maria.
This legend is believed in all Brittany, and a
stained-glass window in the church tells the story.</p>

<p>Behind the church is the Well of Love, so called
because not a day passes that lovers do not come to
test their fate by trying to float pins upon the surface
of the water. If the pins float, all promises
well, and they go away happy. Astute ones
slightly grease the pins, and thus aid destiny.</p>

<p>But to return to the <i>pardon</i>. I remember that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
on this occasion an old cook in the family had permission
to start two or three days before the <i>pardon</i>,
so that she might go all the way on her knees,
and during those days one met many such devout
pilgrims making their way on their knees along
the dusty roads. Some of them came from far
distances. We children were called before dawn
on the August morning, and it was a sleepy, half-bewildered
dressing by candle-light. As a closed
carriage made me sick, I was put into the coupé
with papa and <i>maman</i>. Eliane, Ernest, their
nurses, and all the other servants, followed in a
sort of omnibus, and behind them came all the
horses, trotting gaily along the road to share in
the blessings of this great day of the Assumption
of the Virgin. The horses of Brittany, it will be
conceded, are a specially favored race. Although
I was in the coupé and had all the freshness of the
early air to invigorate me, I remember of the journey
from Loch-ar-Brugg to Folgoat only that I
was deplorably sick, and the greatest inconvenience
to my parents. Fortunately, I was restored
the moment I set my feet upon the ground.

<p class="caption">"Je me sauve," he would exclaim</p>
</div>

<p>We were to be entertained for the day at Folgoat
by the curé, and to lunch with him and with
the bishops at the presbytery; but we were already
ravenously hungry, so, although papa and <i>maman</i>
must continue to fast until after taking communion
at the early service, we children had a splendid
picnic breakfast in the presbytery garden, and a
jellied breast of lamb is my first recollection of the
day at Folgoat! Then we went out to see the
great festival. Seventy-five years or more have
passed since that day, and it still lives in my mind
with a beauty more than splendid, a divine beauty.
In the vast plain, under the vast, blue sky, six bishops,
glittering with gold and precious stones, celebrated
mass simultaneously at six great altars
among thousands of worshipers. It was a sea of
color under the August sun, and the white <i>coiffes</i>
of the women were like flocks of snowy doves.
There was an early mass, and the high mass at
eleven. When this was over, we assembled at the
presbytery to lunch with the bishops. The table
was laid in Anne de Bretagne's council-chamber,
its stone walls covered with archaic figures, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
must have been a picturesque sight to see the bishops
sitting in all their splendor against that ancient
background; but what I most remember are
the stories they told of Louis XI and his misdeeds,
which seemed to me more interesting and more
cruel than the Arabian Nights and Ali Baba and
his forty thieves. In the church itself was shown
a superbly carved bench where, it was said, while
praying, he ordered with a nod the death of a
Breton noble who had refused to do him homage.
When we went into the church after lunch to see
this bench, I sat down on it, and my long golden
curls were caught in the claws of the interlaced
monsters on the back, and I hurt myself so much
in wrenching myself free that I hated still more
fiercely the wicked king who condemned men to
death while he prayed. O the horrid monster!</p>

<p>Then at three came the great procession. First
went the six bishops, mitered and carrying their
croziers; then followed the children of the <i>noblesse</i>,
we among them, all in white, with white
wreaths on our heads; then all the vast multitude,
twenty or thirty abreast, singing canticles, a stupendous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
sight and sound, all marching round the
plain, from altar to altar, under the burning sun.
I remember little after that. The Marquis de
Ploeuc was there, his hair tied in the <i>catogan</i>, and
wearing his black silk suit: I think he must have
lunched with us at the curé's. It was arranged
that he and his two eldest daughters were to drive
back to Loch-ar-Brugg with <i>maman</i> and spend
some days with us, and so, though I must have
been very tired, I was to ride back beside papa on
my pony, which had been duly blessed. It was
already night when we started, and what a wonderful
ride it was! I remember no fatigue. I
still wore my white dress, and <i>maman</i> swathed my
head and shoulders in a white lace shawl, and all
the way back to Loch-ar-Brugg papa told me
stories of hunts, of fairies, of saints, and of escaped
convicts. Every group of trees, every rock,
every turning in the road, had its legend or its adventure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XI<br /><br />
BONNE MAMAN'S DEATH</h3>

<p class="p2">We were at Quimper when <i>bonne maman</i>
died. She had been failing for some
time, and her character, until then so gentle, had
altered. Mere trifles disquieted her, and she became
fretful, alarmed, and even impatient. She
seemed so little in her big bed, and, when I wanted
to climb up beside her, after my wont, she signed
to Jeannie to take me away and said that it tired
her too much to see children and that the air of a
sick-room was not good for them. "Tell my
daughter&mdash;tell her. They must not come!" she
repeated several times in a strange, shrill voice.
I slid down from the bed, I remember, abashed
and disconcerted, and while I longed to see my
dear <i>bonne maman</i> as I had known her, I was
afraid of this changed <i>bonne maman</i>; and it hurt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
me more for her than for myself that she should
be so changed.</p>

<p>But one day when <i>maman</i> was in the room, she
caught sight of me hanging about furtively in the
passage, and called out gently to me to go away,
that <i>bonne maman</i> was tired and was going to
sleep. Then a poor little voice, no longer shrill,
very trembling, came from the bed, saying: "Let
her come, Eliane. It will not hurt me. I want
to see her for a moment."</p>

<p>I approached the bed, walking on tiptoe; the
curtains were drawn to shade <i>bonne maman</i> from
the sunlight, and I softly came and stood within
them. O my poor <i>bonne maman</i>! I could
hardly recognize her. She seemed old&mdash;old and
shrunken, and her eyes no longer smiled. She
looked at me so fixedly that I was frightened, and
she said to <i>maman</i>:</p>

<p>"Lift her up on the bed. I want to kiss her."
She took my hand then, and looked at my little
finger as she always used to do, and said: "I
see that you have been very good with your
mother, but that you don't obey your nurse. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
must always be obedient. You understand me,
don't you, Sophie? Do you say your prayers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>bonne maman</i>," I answered.</p>

<p>"Have you said them this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>bonne maman</i>."</p>

<p>"Say them now."</p>

<p>I made the sign of the cross and said the following
prayer, which I repeated morning and evening
every day, and with slightly altered nomenclature,
my children and grandchildren have repeated,
as I did, until the age of reason: "<i>Mon
Dieu</i>, bless me and bless and preserve <i>grand-père</i>,
<i>bonne maman</i>, <i>maman</i>, <i>papa</i>, my sisters, my
brother, Tiny" [this was my little dog], "Ghislaine,
France, Kerandraon, all my family, and
make me very good. Amen." When I had
finished, <i>bonne maman</i> drew me gently to her,
pressed me in her arms, and kissed me on my eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_212.jpg" width="300" height="422" alt="Paul" />
<p class="caption">Paul</p>
</div>

<p>After this, for how many days I do not remember,
everything became very still in the house.
The servants whispered when they had to speak,
and the older people, when they met us, told us
gently to go into the garden and to be very quiet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
We did not see <i>maman</i> or <i>papa</i> at all. My <i>tante</i>
de Laisieu was with us, and dear France. <i>Bon
papa</i> arrived from Paris. One morning was very
sunny and beautiful, and as I played with Eliane
in the garden I forgot the oppression that weighed
upon us and began to sing to her a Breton song
which Jeannie had taught me. These were the
words:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Le Roy vient demain au château,</p>
<p><span class="o1">"Ecoute moi bien, ma Fleurette,</span></p>
<p>Tu regarderas bien son aigrette!"</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="o1">"Je regarderai," dit Fleurette,</span></p>
<p><span class="o1">"Pour bien reconnaître le Roy!</span></p>
<p>Mes yeux ne verront que toi,</p>
<p>Et mon c&oelig;ur n'aimera que toi."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>While I sang I looked up at <i>bonne maman's</i> window,
for I knew how fond she was of hearing me.
The window was shut, and this was unusual;
so I sang the louder, that she should hear me, of
<i>Fleurette</i> and <i>le Roy</i>. Then France and one of
the servants came running out of the house, and
I saw that both had been crying, and France put
his arm about me while the servant said, "Mademoiselle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
must not sing." And France whispered:
"You will wake <i>bonne maman</i>. Go into the
orchard, dear Sophie. There you will not be
heard." In the evening papa came for us in the
nursery, and I saw that he, too, had been crying.
I had never before seen tears in his dear eyes.
He took us up to <i>maman's</i> room. All the blinds
were drawn down, but I could see her lying on
her bed, in her white woolen <i>peignoir</i>, her arms
crossed behind her head, her black jet rosary lying
along the sheet beside her. We kissed her, one
after the other, and I saw the great tears rolling
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"<i>Maman</i>&mdash;is <i>bonne maman</i> very ill?" I whispered.
I felt that something terrible had happened
to us all.</p>

<p>"My little girl," said <i>maman</i>, "your poor <i>bonne
maman</i> does not suffer any more. She is very
happy now with the angels and <i>le bon Dieu</i>,"
but <i>maman</i> was sobbing as she spoke.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_216.jpg" width="400" height="554" alt="We children had a splendid picnic breakfast" />
<p class="caption">We children had a splendid picnic breakfast</p>
</div>

<p>I knew death only as it had come to one of my
little birds that lived in the round cage hung in the
nursery-window, and I was very much frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
when papa said: "I am going to take Sophie to
your mother's room, Eliane. She is old enough
to understand." But I went with him obediently,
holding his hand. Outside <i>bonne maman's</i> door
he paused and stooped to kiss me and said: "I
know how much you loved your <i>bonne maman</i>,
Sophie, and I want you to say good-by to her,
for you will never see her again. She loved you
so much, my little darling, and you shall be the
last one to kiss her." The room was all black,
and in the middle stood the bed. Beside it, on a
table, a little <i>chapelle</i> had been made with a great
silver cross and candelabra with lighted tapers.
A bunch of fresh box stood in a goblet of holy
water. <i>Bonne maman</i> lay with her arms stretched
out before her, the hands clasped on her black
wooden crucifix with a silver Christ that had always
hung upon her wall. Her hair was not
dressed, but drawn up from her forehead and covered
with a mantilla of white silk Spanish lace,
which fell down over her shoulders on each side.
I stood beside her holding papa's hand. Her profile
was sharply cut against the blackness, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
had never before seen how beautiful it was. Her
eyes were closed, and she smiled tranquilly. I
felt no longer any fear; but when papa lifted me
in his arms so that I might kiss <i>bonne maman</i> and
my lips touched her forehead, a great shock went
through me. How cold her forehead was! O
my poor <i>bonne maman</i>! Even now, after all the
lusters that have passed over me, I feel the cold of
that last kiss.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<h3 class="p6">CHAPTER XII<br /><br />
THE JOURNEY FROM BRITTANY</h3>

<p class="p2">It was not long after <i>bonne maman's</i> death
that we left Brittany and went to Paris to live
with <i>bon papa</i>. I remember every detail of this
my first long journey. The day began with a
very early breakfast, which we all had together
in the dining-room and at which we had the great
treat of drinking chocolate. Then came the complicated
business of stowing us all away in our
capacious traveling-carriage. It was divided into
three compartments. First came what was called
the <i>coupé</i>, with windows at the sides and a large
window in front from which we looked out past
the coachman's red-stockinged legs and along the
horses' backs to where the postilion jounced merrily
against the sky in a red Breton costume like
the coachman's, his long hair tied behind with
black ribbon, a red jockey's cap on his head, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
black shoulder-knots with jet <i>aiguillettes</i>. After
the <i>coupé</i>, and communicating with it by a tiny
passage, though it had doors of its own, was another
compartment for maids, nurses, and children,
and behind that another and larger division for all
the other servants. On the top were seats beside
the coachman, and papa spent most of the day
up there smoking. The luggage, carried on the
top, was covered by a great leather covering,
buckled down all over it, called a <i>bache</i>. The
horses were post-horses, renewed at every post.
It was decided that I was to go in the <i>coupé</i> with
<i>maman</i>, papa, and little Maraquita, as I should
get more fresh air there. I wore, I remember, a
red cashmere dress made out of a dress of
<i>maman's</i>. The material had been brought from
India and was bordered with a design of palm-leaves.
Indeed, this red cashmere must have provided
me with a succession of dresses, for I remember
that when I made my <i>entrée</i> at the <i>Sacré
C&oelig;ur</i> years afterwards, the bishop, visiting the
convent, stopped, smiling, at my bench, and said,
"Why, this is a little Republican, is it not?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Eliane and I both wore <i>capulets</i> on our heads.
These were squares of white cloth that fell to the
shoulders and that folded back from the forehead
and fastened under the chin with bands of black
velvet, a Spanish head-dress. Our cloaks were
the full cloaks, gathered finely around the neck
and shoulders, that <i>maman</i> had made for us,
copied from the peasants' cloaks, of foulard for
summer and wool for winter. Little Maraquita,
who spent most of the three days' journey on <i>maman's</i>
knees, wore, as always until she was seven
or eight, white and pale blue, the Virgin's colors,
as she had been <i>vouée au bleu et au blanc</i> after a
terrible accident that had befallen her in infancy.
She had fallen into the fire at Landerneau, and her
head and forehead had been badly burned, and
<i>maman</i> had thus dedicated her to the Virgin with
prayers that she might not be disfigured&mdash;prayers
that were more than answered, for Maraquita became
exquisitely beautiful. Papa, I may add
here, had many friends and connections in Spain;
hence my little sister's name, and hence our
<i>capulets</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>Eliane and Ernest traveled in the second compartment
with their nurses, Eliane carrying Tiny
and her huge doll, and Ernest, unfortunately for
our peace of mind, a drum of mine that I had
given him and upon which he beat the drumsticks
hour after hour. <i>Maman</i>, in the <i>coupé</i>,
cried out at intervals that it was intolerable to
hear such an incessant noise and that the child
must really, now, be made to stop; but papa always
mildly soothed her, saying: "Let him play.
It keeps him distracted; he would probably be
crying otherwise." So Ernest continued to roll
his drum. In the <i>coupé</i> I was fully occupied in
playing at horses. Real leather reins had been
fixed at each side of the front window, passing
under it so that, looking out over the horses'
haunches, I had the delightful illusion, as I
wielded the reins, of really driving them. I do
not remember that I was sick at all on the first day.
The country was mountainous, and at every steep
hill we all got out and walked down, and this also,
probably helped to preserve me. One feature of
the Brittany landscape of those days stands out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
clearly in my memory, the tall, sinister-looking
telegraph-poles that stood, each one just visible
to the last, on the heights of the country. When
I say telegraph it must not be imagined that they
were our modern electric installations, although
so they were called. These were of a very primitive
and very ingenious construction. At the top
of each pole, by means of the projecting arm that
gave it the look of a gallows, immense wooden
letters were hung out, one after the other; these
letters were worked by means of wires that passed
down the poles into the little hut at its foot.
Each wire at the bottom had a label with its
corresponding letter, and the operator in the hut,
by pulling the wire, pulled the letter into its
place at the top of the pole, and was thus able
laboriously to spell out the message he had to convey
and to make it visible to the operator at the
next post, who passed it on to the next. These
clumsy telegrams could be sent, as far as I remember,
only at certain hours of the day, and I
think that it must have been during a wayside halt
on this journey that I visited a hut with papa and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
had the system explained to me and saw a message
being sent, for I remember the clatter and shaking
as the big letters overhead were pulled into place.
I do not know whether this method of communication
was used all over France, but one or two of
the old poles still survive in Brittany.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/im_224.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="The postilion sounded his horn" />
<p class="caption">The postilion sounded his horn</p>
</div>

<p>Our first stop that day was at Quimperlé. The
postilion, as we approached a town or village,
sounded his horn, and what excitement it caused
in these quiet little places when we came driving
up, and how all the people crowded round us!</p>

<p>The inn at Quimperlé was called the Hôtel du
Trèfle Noir, and though very primitive, the thatch
showing through the rafters in the roof of the
immense kitchen-dining-room, it was scrupulously
clean. We all sat down together at the long
table, servants, coachman, postilion, and all, and
the <i>déjeuner</i> served to us by the good landlady
was fit to put before a king. I remember <i>maman</i>
laughing and asking her why she served the salmon
and, afterward, a heaping golden mound
of fried potatoes, on a great plank, and the landlady
saying that she had no dishes large enough.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
There was a turkey, too, stuffed with chestnuts
and of course <i>crêpes</i> and cream. Next door to
us, in a smaller room, a band of commercial
travelers were also lunching, and as we finished
each course it was carried in to those cheerful
young fellows, whose hurrahs of joy added zest
to our own appetites. That night we slept at
Rennes, where I remember only that I was very
tired and that a horrid man who came to make
a fire in our bedrooms spat upon the floor, to our
disgust and indignation. I remember, too, a very
pleasant crisp cake, or roll, that <i>maman</i> gave me
to eat before I went to bed.</p>

<p>It was on the third day that we drove at last
into Paris, a fairy-land to my gazing, stupefied
eyes. What struck me most were the fountains
of the Place de la Concorde, the bronze mermaids
holding the spouting fish, and the little sunken
gardens, four of them, that at that time surrounded
the obelisk. <i>Bon papa</i> lived in the rue
St. Dominique, St. Germain, and as we drove up
to the door I remember that it was under blossoming
acacia-trees and that the postilion blew a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
blast upon his horn to announce our arrival. The
house, which was, indeed, a very pleasing specimen
of Louis XV architecture, looked palatial to
my childish eyes. <i>Bon papa</i> was standing, very
portly, on the terrace to welcome us, and we ran
into a park behind the house, with an avenue of
horse-chestnuts and a high fountain. But Brittany
was left far behind, and many, many years
were to pass before I again saw my Loch-ar-Brugg.</p>
